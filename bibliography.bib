  abstract = {This study explores whether general specification or specific types of green spaces are associated with mental and general health. A sample of 5,148 respondents from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, conducted in 2006 in Washington State across 98 zip-codes, was analyzed. Measures included mental health complaints (last 30 days), anxiety-depression complaints (last 14 days), and general health status. Percentage of green spaces was derived from the National Land Cover Dataset. The associations were examined in both total and subsamples (urban vs. rural zip-codes). Bivariate correlations and multilevel regression analysis controlling for age, sex, race, income, education level, size of green space, and zip-code population and socio-economic situation indicated `aggregated green space' was not associated with mental and general health. On the other hand, respondents in areas that have more forests report fewer days of mental health complaints in total sample. Results also revealed that more urban green space was associated with fewer days of mental health complaints in urban zip-codes. In addition, size of forest in urban areas was associated with fewer days of mental health complaints. Our findings suggest that types of green space should be considered individually rather than aggregated as `simply green' and `size' of forest in urban areas seems an important factor to affect the relationship between green space and mental health.},

  abstract = {Exposure to green space is associated with a variety of positive health states. Research to date has focused primarily on `generic' green space in urban areas, where green space is relatively scarce and where it is dominated by playing fields and parks. The current research adds to our understanding with an examination of relationships between different types of green space and mental health in rural areas in England (approximate rural population=4 million). The aggregate land cover classes of Land Cover Map 2007 were linked to rural residential areas (Lower-level Super Output Areas) and then linked to rural participants (n=2020) in the 18-year longitudinal British Household Panel Survey. Random effects regression of mental health (as measured by GHQ12 scores) against land cover enabled effects to be simultaneously estimated from both mean between-individual differences and from within-individual differences over time. The nine natural land cover classes (Broadleaved woodland; Coniferous woodland; Arable; Improved grassland; Semi-natural grassland; Mountain, heath and bog; Saltwater; Freshwater; Coastal) were not significantly associated with differences in mental health between individuals. However, significant relationships were observed between some types of land cover and within-individual change in mental health amongst individuals who relocated during the 18 annual waves of the panel. These findings indicate the presence of important health related ecosystem services from different land cover types that have not previously been investigated and which help more effective spatial planning and land use management.},

  abstract = {Introduction In 2015, an estimated 43.4 million Americans aged 18 and older suffered from a behavioral health issue. Accurate estimates of the number of psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurse practitioners are needed as demand for behavioral health care grows. Methods The National Plan and Provider Enumeration System National Provider Identifier data (October 2015) was used to examine the supply of psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurse practitioners. Providers were classified into three geographic categories based on their practicing county (metropolitan, micropolitan, and non-core). Claritas 2014 U.S. population data were used to calculate provider-to-population ratios for each provider type. Analysis was completed in 2016. Results Substantial variation exists across Census Divisions in the per capita supply of psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurse practitioners. The New England Census Division had the highest per capita supply and the West South Central Census Division had among the lowest supply of all three provider types. Nationally, the per capita supply of these providers was substantially lower in non-metropolitan counties than in metropolitan counties, but Census Division disparities persisted across geographic categories. There was a more than tenfold difference in the percentage of counties lacking a psychiatrist between the New England Census Division (6\%) and the West North Central Census Division (69\%). Higher percentages of non-metropolitan counties lacked a psychiatrist. Conclusions Psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurse practitioners are unequally distributed throughout the U.S. Disparities exist across Census Divisions and geographic categories. Understanding this unequal distribution is necessary for developing approaches to improving access to behavioral health services for underserved populations.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies on green space and health have relied almost exclusively on cross-sectional designs, restricting understanding on how this relationship could vary across the lifecourse. METHODS: We used multilevel linear regression to analyse variation in minor psychiatric morbidity over nine annual waves of the British Household Panel Survey (1996-2004). The sample was restricted to residents of urban areas who remained within their neighbourhoods for at least 12 months. The 12-item General Health Questionnaire and confounders were reported for 29 626 male and 35 781 female observations (person-years). This individual-level dataset was linked to a measure of green space availability within each ward of residence. Regression models included age, gender, employment status, household tenure, marital status, education, smoking status and household income. RESULTS: When not considering age, green space was associated with better mental health among men, but not women. Interaction terms fitted between age and green space revealed variation in the association between green space and mental health across the lifecourse and by gender. For men, the benefit of more green space emerged in early to mid-adulthood. Among older women, a curvilinear association materialised wherein those with a moderate availability of green space had better mental health. CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate how the relationship between urban green space and health can vary across the lifecourse, and they highlight the need for longitudinal studies to answer why green space may be better for health at some points in the lifecourse than others.},

  abstract = {Recent studies indicate that living near more green space may support mental  and general health and may also prevent depression. However, most studies are cross-sectional, and few have considered whether some types of green space matter more for mental health.To assess whether total green space or specific types of green space are associated with better mental health.This cohort study included a residentially stable, city-dwelling sample of 46\,786 participants from Sydney, Wollongong, and Newcastle, Australia, in the baseline of the Sax Institute's 45 and Up Study (data collected from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2009). Follow-up was conducted from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2015. Analyses were conducted in January 2019.Percentage of total green space, tree canopy, grass, and other low-lying vegetation measured within 1.6-km (1-mile) road network distance buffers around residential addresses at baseline.Three outcome variables were examined at baseline (prevalence) and follow-up (incidence without baseline affirmatives): (1) risk of psychological distress (10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale), (2) self-reported physician-diagnosed depression or anxiety, and (3) fair to poor self-rated general health.This study included 46\,786 participants (mean [SD] age, 61.0 [10.2] years; 25 171 [53.8\%] female). At baseline, 5.1\% of 37\,775 reported a high risk of psychological distress, 16.0\% of 46\,786 reported depression or anxiety, and 9.0\% of 45\,577 reported fair to poor self-rated health. An additional 3.3\% of 32\,991 experienced psychological distress incidence, 7.5\% of 39\,277 experienced depression or anxiety incidence, and 7.3\% of 40\,741 experienced fair to poor self-rated health incidence by follow-up (mean [SD] of 6.2 [1.62] years later). Odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for age, sex, income, economic status, couple status, and educational level indicated that exposures of 30\% or more total green space (OR, 0.46; 95\% CI, 0.29-0.69) and tree canopy specifically (OR, 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.54-0.88) were associated with lower incidence of psychological distress. Exposure to tree canopy of 30\% or more, compared with 0\% to 9\%, was also associated with lower incidence of fair to poor general health (OR, 0.67; 95\% CI, 0.57-0.80). Exposure to grass of 30\% or more, compared with 0\% to 4\%, was associated with higher odds of incident fair to poor general health (OR, 1.47; 95\% CI, 1.12-1.91) and prevalent psychological distress (OR, 1.71; 95\% CI, 1.25-2.28). Exposure to low-lying vegetation was not consistently associated with any outcome. No green space indicator was associated with prevalent or incident depression or anxiety.Protection and restoration of urban tree canopy specifically, rather than any urban greening, may be a good option for promotion of community mental health.},

Methods This longitudinal study examined the odds of prevalent and incident insufficient sleep in relation to indicators of total green space, tree canopy, open grass and other low-lying vegetation in the Sax Institute's 45 and Up Study (baseline 2006\textendash 2009; follow-up 2012\textendash 2015). Association between green space within 1.6\,km road distances and insufficient sleep among 38,982 participants living in Sydney, Wollongong or Newcastle were analysed using multilevel logistic regressions adjusted for confounding. Results Participants with more total green space had lower odds of prevalent insufficient sleep (e.g. {$\geq$}30\% compared with 0-4\% total green space odds ratio (OR)\,=\,0.68, 95\% credible interval (95\%CI)\,=\,0.53, 0.85). The odds of prevalent insufficient sleep were lower among participants with more tree canopy (e.g. {$\geq$}30\% compared with 0-9\% tree canopy OR\,=\,0.78, 95\%CI 0.69, 0.88). The odds of incident insufficient sleep were also lower with more tree canopy (e.g. {$\geq$}30\% compared with 0-9\% tree canopy OR\,=\,0.87, 95\%CI\,=\,0.75, 0.99). There were no statistically significant associations between prevalent or incident insufficient sleep with open grass or other low-lying vegetation, nor incident sufficient sleep with total green space.

  abstract = {The demand for opioid medication to effectively treat pain has contributed to the surging opioid crisis, which is a major source of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. More than 100,000 people begin opioid maintenance treatment (OMT) annually, the standard pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder (OUD). Although OMT is the standard care for OUD, patients often experience or develop a heightened sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia) as a result of the opioid medication, and also have high rates of stress, affective, and anxiety-related conditions. These conditions are interactive with other behavioral and environmental correlates of opioid and other substance use disorders including impulsive decision-making (e.g., harmful opioid use associated with increased delay discounting), and a lack of alternative (i.e., substance-free) and social reinforcement. Collectively these complex and multifaceted factors constitute significant predictors of lack of adherence to OMT (and other pharmacotherapies) and relapse. There is an urgent need, therefore, to develop novel adjunctive treatments that preserve the benefits of OMT and various pharmacotherapies, and simultaneously diminish continued pain and hyperalgesia, reduce stress and anxiety-related conditions, target relevant behavioral mechanism such as impulsive choice, and also serve to enhance the value of alternative and substance free activities. Here, we discuss evidence that an environmental manipulation \textendash{} access to greenspace and nature \textendash{} could serve as a potential adjunctive treatment to standard pharmacotherapies by targeting multiple biological and behavioral mechanisms that standard pharmacotherapies do not address.},

  abstract = {Prior studies suggest that exposure to the natural environment may be important for optimal mental health. The present study examines the association between block-level greenness (vegetative presence) and mental health outcomes, in a population-based sample of 249,405 U.S. Medicare beneficiaries aged {$\geq$}65 years living in Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA, whose location did not change from 2010 to 2011. Multilevel analyses examined relationships between greenness, as measured by mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from satellite imagery at the Census block level, and each of two mental health outcomes; Alzheimer's disease and depression, respectively, after statistically adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and neighborhood income level of the individuals. Higher block-level greenness was linked to better mental health outcomes: There was a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (by 18\%) and depression (by 28\%) for beneficiaries living in blocks that were 1 SD above the mean for greenness, as compared to blocks that were 1 SD below the mean. Planned post-hoc analyses revealed that higher levels of greenness were associated with even greater mental health benefits in low-income neighborhoods: An increase in greenness from 1 SD below to 1 SD above the mean was associated with 37\% lower odds of depression in low-income neighborhoods, compared to 27\% and 21\% lower odds of depression in medium- and high-income neighborhoods, respectively. Greenness may be effective in promoting mental health in older adults, particularly in low-income neighborhoods, possibly as a result of the increased opportunities for physical activity, social interaction, or stress mitigation.},

  abstract = {Examination of the greenspace-human health relationship operates in at least four dimensions: what is considered greenspace? which moderators and mediators are included? what outcomes are measured? and which units of analysis (e.g., individuals, cities) are studied? We examined three of these four dimensions in a cross-sectional study of 496 of the 500 most populated US cities (total population size = 97,574,613, average population per city = 197,920). Spatial average models tested the effect of two greenspace measures (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index greenness and tree cover) on two outcomes (obesity and mental health), while adjusting for income, race and ethnicity, sprawl, age, sex, physical inactivity, median age of housing, and total population. We conducted analyses at the city scale, which is an understudied unit of analysis, and compared findings to individual- and neighborhood-level studies. In two of four models, greenspace was associated with better health. We found race and ethnicity moderated this relationship with varying results. In full sample analyses, cities with greater percentages of non-Hispanic Whites showed links between higher tree cover and lower obesity but marginal relationships between higher greenness and lower obesity. In subsample analyses with majority-non-Hispanic Black cities, higher tree cover was associated with lower obesity and better mental health. These findings advance previous research by showing that race and ethnicity moderate the greenspace-health link at the city level.},

  abstract = {Greenspace in urban areas may have greater protective health effects than elsewhere. Urban dwellers experience more environmental harmful exposures, attentional demands, and stressors than their suburban/rural counterparts. In this systematic review, we synthesize the results of studies that examined how the greenspace and health relationship varies by urbanicity. We searched for articles in April 2019 that found positive associations between greenspace and physical health. Included articles tested for effect modification by urbanicity among one or more (of eight total) outcomes relevant to health and environmental equity. We coded results as 1~=~stronger association in more urban areas, -1~=~stronger association in less urban areas, or 0~=~no difference. We found 57 analyses in 37 articles that met our inclusion criteria. Among these analyses, 50.9\% showed no difference, 38.6\% showed a stronger association for more urban areas, and 10.5\% showed a stronger association for less urban areas. More urban areas had stronger associations for cardiovascular-related, birth, and mortality outcomes and for greenspace measured within 500~m. Stronger greenspace-health associations in more urban areas might be explained in part by the mechanistic pathways underlying these associations. Greenspace can reduce harms from environmental exposures (i.e., air pollution, noise, heat, and artificial light at night) in addition to alleviating attentional demands, reducing chronic stressors, and promoting healthy behavior - factors which might be more necessary, prevalent, or stronger in urban areas. These potential explanations warrant further investigation. The findings of this review inform public health policy and planning professionals who are attempting to make cities livable for all residents.},

  abstract = {In Charlotte, North Carolina less than one half of 1\% of commuters ride a bicycle to work despite several decades of public investment in bicycle infrastructure and planning. Like many fast-growing cities of North America, Charlotte's rapid physical growth in the past half-century has left its residents little option but to navigate the city by car. To date, research on utility cycling has paid relatively little attention to the practice of bicycle commuting in auto-dominated cities. This article uses grounded theory methodology to build a context- and time-sensitive explanation of how individuals adopt and sustain the practice of bicycle commuting in Charlotte. Through interviews with 26 Charlotte-area bicycle commuters\textemdash 20 men and 6 women, mean age 40.3\textemdash, we find that, according to subjects interviewed, initiating and sustaining the practice of bicycle commuting involves the renegotiation of relationships between the cyclist and (1) the bicycle, (2) other local cyclists, (3) urban space, and (4) the workplace. Dynamics in these relationships are overlapping and simultaneous. This time- and context-sensitive explanation broadens the array of policy interventions that complement the infrastructure-centered approach to promoting cycling in Charlotte today. Elected officials, planners, and bicycle advocates stand to benefit by understanding the transition to cycling as a process of social learning that exposes individuals interested in bicycle commuting to less hostile ``neighborhood'' thoroughfares.},

A mixed methods research project conducted in Perth, Western Australia examined the role that neighbourhood green space played in influencing residents' self-reported health status, and this paper identifies significant relationships found between perceptions of green space quality and self-reported health. It focuses on the factors that were found to be most positively associated with better health outcomes: proximity, retention, useability and visitation of neighbourhood green space.},

  abstract = {Urban densification and mixed-use development may have unintended consequences and should be informed by research that anticipates their varied outcomes. The purpose of this study is to understand the association between sleep duration/problems and different land use types (commercial, residential, industrial, green space), and to further explore the role of traffic and noise as potential mechanisms for how land use can impact sleep. Using multilevel logistic and multinomial logistic regressions, we analyzed the association between land use and sleep duration/problems for a cross-sectional sample of 2411 participants across 443 dissemination areas in Toronto, Canada. We found positive associations between sleep problems/duration and commercial density, residential density, and industrial land use. However, these associations were fully attenuated once we controlled for traffic levels and self-rated noise, which suggests that land use was associated with elevated levels of noise and traffic, which in turn negatively impacted sleep. Density of green space was not independently associated with sleep duration/problems. Given the importance of noise and traffic as mediators between land use and sleep duration/problems, further research should evaluate whether site-planning and architectural solutions to reduce exterior noise and exposure to traffic can ameliorate these potentially negative effects of certain land uses. Les effets de l'occupation du sol en milieu urbain sur la dur\'ee et les troubles du sommeil La densification urbaine et les projets d'am\'enagement \`a usage mixte ont parfois des cons\'equences impr\'evues et devraient \^etre \'eclair\'es par des recherches fond\'ees sur leurs multiples effets. Cette \'etude vise \`a faire la lumi\`ere sur l'association entre la dur\'ee/les troubles du sommeil et les diff\'erents types d'occupation du sol (commercial, r\'esidentiel, industriel, espace vert), et d'examiner plus en d\'etail le r\^ole de la circulation et du bruit comme m\'ecanisme par lequel l'occupation du sol peut influencer le sommeil. \`A l'aide de mod\`eles de r\'egression logistique multiniveau et multinomiale, une analyse a \'et\'e men\'ee sur l'association entre l'occupation du sol et la dur\'ee/les troubles du sommeil \`a partir d'un \'echantillon transversal de 2 411 participants qui r\'esident dans 443 aires de diffusion \`a Toronto, Canada. Des associations positives ont \'et\'e trouv\'ees entre la dur\'ee/les troubles du sommeil et la densit\'e commerciale, la densit\'e r\'esidentielle, et l'occupation du sol \`a des fins industrielles. Cependant, ces associations sont remises en cause quand les effets des niveaux de trafic et du bruit auto\'evalu\'e ont \'et\'e contr\^ol\'es, ce qui semble indiquer qu'une association existe entre l'occupation du sol et les niveaux \'elev\'es de bruit et de trafic, lesquels ont \`a leur tour un impact n\'egatif sur le sommeil. La densit\'e de l'espace vert n'est pas associ\'ee de mani\`ere ind\'ependante avec la dur\'ee/les troubles du sommeil. Compte tenu de l'importance du bruit et de la circulation en tant qu'interm\'ediaires entre l'occupation du sol et la dur\'ee/les troubles du sommeil, les travaux futurs devraient \'evaluer si l'am\'enagement des sites et les solutions architecturales pour r\'eduire le bruit ext\'erieur et l'exposition \`a la circulation peuvent contrer ces effets potentiellement n\'egatifs de certains types d'occupation du sol.},

  abstract = {The past 35 years has seen an accumulation of empirical evidence suggesting a positive association between greenspace and mental health. Existing reviews of evidence are narrow in scope, and do not adequately represent the broad range of disciplines working in this field. This study is the first systematic map of studies investigating greenspace effects on mental health. A total of 6059 papers were screened for their relevance, 276 of which met inclusion criteria for the systematic map.{$<$}br/{$><$}br/{$>$}The map revealed several methodological limitations hindering the practical applications of research findings to public health. Critically, the majority of studies used cross-sectional mental health data which makes causal inference about greenspace effects challenging. There are also few studies on the micro-features that make up greenspaces (i.e., their ``quality''), with most focussing only on ``quantity'' effects on mental health. Moreover, few studies adopted a multi-scale approach, meaning there is little evidence about at which spatial scale(s) the relationship exists. A geographic gap in study location was also identified, with the majority of studies clustered in European countries and the USA.{$<$}br/{$><$}br/{$>$}Future research should account for both human and ecological perspectives of ``quality'' using objective and repeatable measures, and consider the potential of scale-dependent greenspace effects to ensure that management of greenspace is compatible with wider scale biodiversity targets. To establish the greenspace and metal health relationship across a life course, studies should make better use of longitudinal data, as this enables stronger inferences to be made than more commonly used cross-sectional data.},

The paper utilizes data from the housing market near downtown Los Angeles. We first used a standard hedonic model to estimate greenspace effects. Because the residuals were spatially autocorrelated, we implemented a spatial lag model as indicated by specification tests. Our results show that neighborhood greenspace at the immediate vicinity of houses has a significant impact on house prices even after controlling for spatial autocorrelation. The different estimation results from non-spatial and spatial models provide useful bounds for the greenspace effect. Greening of inner city areas may provide a valuable policy instrument for elevating depressed housing markets in those areas.},

To validate the measure of park appeal, we will use visitation to individual parks in 2018 based on a large panel of smartphone devices representing approximately 10\% of the adult population in our study area (SafeGraph, 2021). We expect that park size, features, amenities, and user perceptions each increase the appeal of parks and thus are associated with park visitation, even when adjusting for contextual characteristics that influence demand for parks (e.g., population in proximity).  The second aim is to examine socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in park access. We hypothesize disparities in park appeal, such that neighborhood economic disadvantage and share of Hispanic residents are associated with access to less appealing parks (i.e., parks that are smaller, have fewer features and amenities, and lower user ratings) (Boone et al., 2009; Hughey et al., 2016; Rigolon, 2016). We make no directional hypotheses concerning differences in park density by neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage or racial/ethnic composition given prior mixed literature on disparities in park proximity and density (Rigolon, 2016, 2017; Wen et al., 2013). We will also explore disparities in park visitation by neighborhood characteristics after adjusting for differences in park appeal, but we make no specific hypotheses.},

Green and blue space availability were expressed as percentages of the area within 1 km from one's home.                                                        Results               The hypotheses were confirmed, except for green space and mood disorders. Associations were generally stronger for blue space than for green space, with ORs up to 0.74 for a 10\%-point increase.                                         Conclusions               Despite the different survey design and health measures, the results largely replicate those of previous studies on green space. Blue space availability deserves more systematic attention.},

  abstract = {Making our cities more sustainable includes the need to make the transition a just one. This paper focuses on distributive justice with regard to greenspace in cities. Urbanisation and densification will likely result in less greenspace in urban residential areas, especially in deprived neighbourhoods. This is a threat to the aim of healthy and liveable cities, as greenspace has positive effects on human health and well-being. In this study, we show that in The Netherlands, neighbourhoods with a low socioeconomic status already tend to have a lower presence and quality of greenspace than those with a high socioeconomic status. This outcome is independent of the greenness metric that was used. However, depending on the precise greenness metric, socioeconomic differences in greenness between neighbourhoods are smaller in highly urban municipalities than in less urban municipalities, rather than larger. The paper discusses the implications of these outcomes for policy and planning regarding urban greenspace.},

These products provide spatially explicit and reliable information on the Nation\&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;iuml;\&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;iquest;\&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;frac12;s land cover and land cover change. To continue the legacy of NLCD and further establish a long-term monitoring capability for the Nation\&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;iuml;\&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;iquest;\&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;frac12;s land resources, the USGS has designed a new generation of NLCD products named NLCD 2016. The NLCD 2016 design aims to provide innovative, consistent, and robust methodologies for production of a multi-temporal land cover and land cover change database from 2001 to 2016 at 2\&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;iuml;\&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;iquest;\&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;frac12;3-year intervals. Comprehensive research was conducted and resulted in developed strategies for NLCD 2016: a streamlined process for assembling and preprocessing Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a multi-source integrated training data development and decision-tree based land cover classifications; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover change analysis strategy; a hierarchical theme-based post-classification and integration protocol for generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling method; and an automated scripted operational system for the NLCD 2016 production. The performance of the developed strategies and methods were tested in twenty World Reference System-2 path/row throughout the conterminous U.S. An overall agreement ranging from 71\% to 97\% between land cover classification and reference data was achieved for all tested area and all years. Results from this study confirm the robustness of this comprehensive and highly automated procedure for NLCD 2016 operational mapping.

For the purpose of developing healthy urban neighbourhoods, this raises the question how to take scientific evidence about these health benefits into account. Accessibility metrics that are well substantiated by empirical evidence are needed. This paper reviews the quantitative and qualitative aspects relevant for accessibility metrics and empirical studies addressing these aspects in relation to health. Studies comparing different types of green space indicators suggest that cumulative opportunities indicators are more consistently positively related to health than residential proximity ones. In contrast to residential proximity indicators, cumulative opportunities indicators take all the green space within a certain distance into account. Comparing results across studies proved to be hard. Green space accessibility was measured in a variety of ways and the green space indicator that was chosen was often not problematized. We feel that it is time for a more function-oriented approach. How precisely does contact with nature impact health and what type and qualities are relevant in this regard? We think this will lead to a new generation of more evidence-based accessibility metrics that will help to advance the field.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There are few studies on the potential benefits of green space quantity and quality for child well-being. The authors hypothesized that more and better quality residential green space would be favorable for well-being and that these associations could be subject to effect modification across childhood. METHOD: Multilevel linear regression adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic confounders was used to track change in well-being (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire Total Difficulties Score and "internalizing" and "externalizing" subscales) across five separate occasions among a cohort of 4,968 Australian children aged 4-5 years beginning in 2004. Well-being was assessed with respect to objectively measured green space quantity and parent-reported green space quality, with interaction terms fitted with age to assess for potential effect modification. Data were analyzed in 2015. RESULTS: Non-linear dose-response associations were observed for favorable well-being in relation to larger quantities of green space and also green space judged to be higher in quality. Favorable perceptions of green space quality were associated with larger quantities of green space regardless of neighborhood socioeconomic circumstances. Benefits for well-being appeared to top out at 21\%-40\% green space coverage and were reasonably consistent across childhood. Inequality in well-being (especially the internalizing subscale) emerged as children aged in relation to green space quality. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 21\%-40\% of residential land-use allocated to green space may be an optimal amount for promoting child well-being, but the quality of this green space increases in importance as children age.},

We hypothesised that children and adolescents living in greener areas would have better quality and more sufficient levels of sleep on average, especially within the context of high traffic noise exposure. These hypotheses were tested using multilevel logistic regressions fitted on samples from the nationally representative Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (10\textendash 11 years old, n = 3469, and 14\textendash 15 years old, n = 2814) and the GINIplus and LISA cohorts (10 years old, n = 1461, and 15 years old, n = 4172) from the Munich, Wesel, and Leipzig areas of Germany. Questionnaire-based binary indicators of sleep sufficiency and sleep quality in each cohort were assessed with respect to objectively measured green space exposures adjusting for age, sex, and maternal education. Models were augmented with proxy measures of traffic noise and two-way interaction terms to test for effect modification. Cross-tabulations illustrated little convincing evidence of association between green space and insufficient sleep or poor sleep quality in either sample, except for insufficient sleep among 10 year old participants in Germany. These null findings were replicated in adjusted models. The proxy for traffic noise was associated with poor quality sleep in 15 year old participants in Germany, but no convincing evidence of modified association with green space was observed.},

  abstract = {Exploratory spatial data analysis is often a preliminary step to more formal modelling approaches that seek to establish relationships between the observations of a variable and the observations of other variables, recorded for each areal unit. The focus in this chapter is on spatial regression models in a simple cross-sectional setting, leaving out of consideration the analysis of panel data. We, moreover, assume that the data concerned can be taken to be approximately normally distributed. This assumption is\textemdash to varying degrees\textemdash involved in most of the spatial regression techniques that we will consider. Note that the assumption of normality is not tenable if the variable of interest is a count or a proportion. In these cases we would expect models for such data to involve probability distributions such as the Poisson or binomial. The chapter consists of five sections, starting with a treatment of the specification of spatial dependence in a regression model. Next, specification tests are considered to detect the presence of spatial dependence. This is followed by a review of the spatial Durbin model (SDM) that nests many of the models widely used in the literature, and by a discussion of spatial regression model estimation based on the maximum likelihood (ML) principle. The chapter closes with some remarks on model parameter interpretation, an issue that had been largely neglected so far. Readers interested in implementing the models, methods and techniques discussed in this chapter find useful MATLAB code which is publicly available at spatial-econometrics.com, LeSage's spatial econometrics toolbox (downloadable from http://www.spatial-econometrics.com/ ), see Liu and LeSage (2010) Journal of Geographical Systems 12(1):69\textendash 87 for a brief description.

Results reveal that Norwegians perceive their green spaces as having good quality, and higher quality perceptions have a positive influence on green space visits. Half of the respondents visited green spaces out of intrinsic motives in high-quality environments providing fresh air, experiences of nature and quietness. It is essential, however, to take into account that less reported activity mirrors groups of respondents who least often visit green spaces.},

The slope of mental health visits changed from 0.22 youths/1000/year (CI, 0.02 to 0.42) during 2003 to 2009 to 1.84 youths/1000/year (CI, 1.38 to 2.30) in 2009 to 2017 (P {$<$} 0.001). Females were more likely to have self-harm (P {$<$} 0.001) and mental health visits (P {$<$} 0.001). Rates of increase after 2009 were greater for females for both self-harm (P {$<$} 0.001) and mental health (P {$<$} 0.001).Conclusions:Rates of adolescents with self-harm and mental health ED visits have increased since 2009, with greater increases among females. Research is required on the determinants of adolescents? self-harm and mental health ED visits and how they can be addressed in that setting. Sufficient treatment resources must be supplied to address increased demands for services.},

Method This was a population-based cross-sectional cohort study using linked health and demographic administrative datasets of youth 10 to 24 years of age with an incident MH ED visit from April 1, 2010, to March 31, 2014, in Ontario, Canada. We modeled the association of demographic, clinical, and health service use characteristics with having no prior outpatient MH care in the preceding 2-year period (``first contact'') using modified Poisson models. Results Among 118,851 youth with an incident mental health ED visit, 14.0\% were admitted. More than half (53.5\%) had no prior outpatient MH care, and this was associated with younger age (14-17 versus 22-24 years old: risk ratio [RR]~= 1.09, 95\% CI~=~1.07-1.10), rural residence (RR~= 1.16, 95\% CI~=~1.14-1.18), lowest versus highest income quintile (RR~= 1.04, 95\% CI~= 1.03-1.06), and refugee immigrants (RR~= 1.17, 95\% CI~= 1.13-1.21) and other immigrants (RR~= 1.10, 95\% CI~= 1.08-1.13) versus nonimmigrants. The 5.1\% of the cohort without a usual provider of primary care had the highest risk of first contact (RR~=~1.78, 95\% CI~= 1.77-1.80). A history of low-acuity ED use and individuals whose primary care physicians were in the lowest tertile for mental health visit volumes were associated with higher risk. Conclusion More than half of youth requiring ED care had not previously sought outpatient MH care. Associations with multiple markers of primary care access characteristics suggest that timely primary care could prevent some of these visits.},

  abstract = {While urban greening initiatives are becoming increasing prevalent, some critical scholars have started to question the neutrality of this movement. Specifically, scholars have demonstrated that urban greening can inflate housing costs and as such give rise to processes of gentrification and displacement. This article examines processes of green gentrification in a particular neighborhood of Ghent (Belgium) that has been profoundly greened during the last two decades. Drawing on in-depth interviews with both gentrifying and longtime residents, we find that longtime residents are experiencing significant displacement pressures as a result of urban greening. However, rather than predominantly caused by soaring costs, displacement pressures seem to follow mainly from the political, social, and cultural changes encompassing greening initiatives. Consequently, we draw a more complex picture of green gentrification, one that has important implications for the way this process should be addressed.},

Methods In a time-stratified case-crossover design, we regressed cause-specific mortality against EH (indicator for 4-day mean, minimum, maximum or apparent temperature above 97th or 99th percentiles). We examined effect modification with interactions between EH and personal marital status, age, race, sex and education and ZIP-code percent ``non-green space'' (National Land Cover Dataset), age, race, income, education, living alone, and housing age (U.S. Census). Results In models including multiple effect modifiers, the odds of cardiovascular mortality during EH (99th percentile threshold) vs. non-EH were higher among non-married individuals (1.21, 95\% CI=1.14\textendash 1.28 vs. 0.98, 95\% CI=0.90\textendash 1.07 among married individuals) and individuals in ZIP codes with high (91\%) non-green space (1.17, 95\% CI=1.06\textendash 1.29 vs. 0.98, 95\% CI=0.89\textendash 1.07 among individuals in ZIP codes with low (39\%) non-green space). Results suggested that housing age may also be an effect modifier. For the EH-respiratory mortality association, the results were inconsistent between temperature metrics and percentile thresholds of EH but largely insignificant. Conclusions Green space, housing and social isolation may independently enhance elderly peoples' heat-related cardiovascular mortality vulnerability. Local adaptation efforts should target areas and populations at greater risk.},

We studied how suicide mortality is associated with changes in the physical and social neighbourhood environment for movers and non-movers. Our retrospective analysis was based on longitudinal register data for the entire Dutch population aged 25\textendash 64 years enriched with annually time-varying data on the residential neighbourhood environment between 2007 and 2016. A total of 8,741,021 people were followed-up between 2007 and 2016 of which 10,019 committed suicide. Upward and downward neighbourhood change was measured by comparing neighbourhood conditions separately at two time points. Cox proportional hazard models indicated that movers had a significantly lower risk of suicide compared to non-movers. Suicide risk was lower for people experiencing improvements in social fragmentation and deprivation compared to those remaining in poor conditions. Change from rural to urban conditions also resulted in lower suicide risk, while a gain in green space put people at increased risk. For those stable neighbourhood conditions over time, suicide mortality was lower for men and women in urban vs. rural neighbourhoods as well as for women in neighbourhoods with low vs. high social fragmentation. Stable exposure to high levels of green space resulted in higher suicide risk among women. Interactions and stratification by moving type revealed associations between neighbourhood change and suicide were more pronounced in non-movers. Our findings suggest that neighbourhood improvements might contribute to a lower suicide risk, especially for long-term residents in poor neighbourhood conditions.},

  abstract = {The debate over metropolitan sprawl and its costs has been ongoing since the early 1970s in the U.S. To inform the debate, this study uses principal component analysis (PCA) and 2010 cross sectional data for large U.S. urbanized areas (UZAs) to operationalize compactness/sprawl in each of four dimensions\textemdash development density, land use mix, activity centering, and street accessibility. Higher values represent greater compactness, lower values greater sprawl. The four factors are then combined into an overall compactness/sprawl index. The study then applies factor score coefficient values for 2010 to the same variables for 2000 to create comparable metrics for 2000. Compactness scores for 2000 are compared to the same scores for 2010 to see which UZAs sprawled the most between censuses, and which sprawled the least or actually became more compact. Finally, the study validates the compactness index and its component factors against transportation outcomes for 2010, specifically walk mode share, transit mode share, and average drive time on the journey to work. If sprawl has any widely accepted outcome, it is automobile dependence and heavy automobile use. Consistent with this characterization of sprawl, this study finds that the overall compactness index bears a strong relationship to transportation outcomes. Generalizing across the entire universe of large urbanized areas in the U.S., compactness decreased and sprawl increased between the two census years; but only slightly. Several urbanized areas, however, have significantly different rankings in 2000 than 2010.},

  abstract = {Background Natural outdoor environments, such as green spaces (ie, grass, forests, or parks), blue spaces (ie, visible bodies of fresh or salt water), and coastal proximity, have been increasingly shown to promote mental health. However, little is known about how and the extent to which these natural environments are associated with suicide mortality. Our aim was to investigate whether the availability of green space and blue space within people's living environments and living next to the coast are protective against suicide mortality. Methods In this cross-sectional, ecological study, we analysed officially confirmed deaths by suicide between 2005 and 2014 per municipality in the Netherlands. We calculated indexes to measure the proportion of green space and blue space per municipality and the coastal proximity of each municipality using a geographical information system. We fitted Bayesian hierarchical Poisson regressions to assess associations between suicide risk, green space, blue space, and coastal proximity, adjusted for risk and protective factors. Findings Municipalities with a large proportion of green space (relative risk 0{$\cdot$}879, 95\% credibility interval 0{$\cdot$}779\textendash 0{$\cdot$}991) or a moderate proportion of green space (0{$\cdot$}919, 0{$\cdot$}846\textendash 0{$\cdot$}998) showed a reduced suicide risk compared with municipalities with less green space. Green space did not differ according to urbanicity in relation to suicide. Neither blue space nor coastal proximity was associated with suicide risk. The geographical variation in the residual relative suicide risk was substantial and the south of the Netherlands was at high risk. Interpretation Our findings support the notion that exposure to natural environments, particularly to greenery, might have a role in reducing suicide mortality. If confirmed by future studies on an individual level, the consideration of environmental exposures might enrich suicide prevention programmes.

Green space provision has to be based on the principle of equity. This study investigated the presence of socioeconomic inequalities in geographic accessibility and quality of green spaces across Porto neighbourhoods (Portugal). Methods: Accessibility was evaluated using a Geographic Information System and all the green spaces were audited using the Public Open Space Tool. Kendall's tau-b correlation coefficients and ordinal regression were used to test whether socioeconomic differences in green space quality and accessibility were statistically significant. Results: Although the majority of the neighbourhoods had an accessible green space, mean distance to green space increased with neighbourhood deprivation. Additionally, green spaces in the more deprived neighbourhoods presented significantly more safety concerns, signs of damage, lack of equipment to engage in active leisure activities, and had significantly less amenities such as seating, toilets, caf\'es, etc. Conclusions: Residents from low socioeconomic positions seem to suffer from a double jeopardy; they lack both individual and community resources. Our results have important planning implications and might contribute to understanding why deprived communities have lower physical activity levels and poorer health.},

Methods We conducted a cross-sectional, time-series analysis from 2010 to 2016 of mental health visits, identified by billing diagnosis codes, among children 5 to 18years old in a tertiary pediatric ED. We used Poisson regression to analyze trends in rates of mental health visits, patient-hours, and visits with LOS {$\geq$} 24hours. We used time-series analysis to trend median costs per visit. Results From 2010 to 2016, there were 197,982 ED visits and 13,367 (6.7\%) mental health visits. Mental health visits increased by 45\% (from 1462 to 2119), compared to a 13\% increase in non\textendash mental health visits.

  abstract = {While local-area greenspace is associated with reduced symptoms of mental distress and greater life satisfaction, most previous research has measured the amount of local-area greenspace within administrative boundaries, and found mixed results for associations between greenspace and multidimensional mental wellbeing. The study was designed to examine whether the amount of greenspace within a radius of individuals' homes was associated with mental wellbeing, testing the government guideline that greenspace should be available within 300\,m of homes. Individual and Household-level data were drawn from the Annual Population Survey at postcode level (APS, Pooled Dataset 2012\textendash 2015), which includes 3 mental wellbeing measures, covering aspects of life satisfaction, sense of worth, and happiness, as well as a range of socio-demographic variables. Greenspace data were obtained Greenspace Information for Greater London Group (GiGL), and was used to calculated the amount of greenspace within a 300\,m radius of individuals. Linear regression models revealed positive and statistically significant associations between the amount of greenspace and indicators of life satisfaction and worth. Moran's I, an indicator of spatial autocorrelation, revealed statistically significant clustering of the residuals of these models, so Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models were calculated, in order to adjust for underlying spatial processes within the data and investigate the geographic variation in the association between local greenspace and mental wellbeing. The global GWR model revealed that an increase in 1\,ha of greenspace within 300\,m of residents was associated with a statistically significant 0.803 increase in life satisfaction, 0.740 and 0.521 for worth and happiness, respectively. This therefore provides some support for the inclusion of greenspace within 300\,m of homes. Local GWR coefficients revealed slight variation in the strength of these associations across the study space. Therefore, further analyses are required to investigate whether the walking (network distance), absolute size, or type of each greenspace are able to explain this spatial variation.},

However, many studies consider greenspace as a single entity, which overlooks the potential significance of the various forms of greenspace, and natural greenspaces in particular. This study was designed to investigate the association between different types of greenspace and mental wellbeing. Drawing wellbeing and socioeconomic data from the Annual Population Survey (2012\textendash 2015), and shapefiles from the Greenspace Information for Greater London group, the amount of greenspace accessible within a 300\,m walk of individual's postcodes was calculated, and categorised according to type. Spatial Error Models were used to account for spatial patterns in the data. Natural greenspace was significantly associated with improved life satisfaction (B\,=\,0.028, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and happiness (B\,=\,0.023, p\,=\,0.019) scores.

These results imply that natural areas may be more important for hedonic mental wellbeing than other greenspaces.

  abstract = {Although numerous studies have investigated the effect of green space on mental health, as yet, little is known about the association between green space and suicide. To address this deficit, we conducted the first Japan-wide study of the relationship between green space and suicide mortality. Results from spatial analyses of municipality-level panel data for the 1975\textendash 2014 period that included 886,440 suicide deaths with a fixed-effect estimator showed that green space was associated with suicide mortality, and that this relationship was conditioned by the form of greenness, level of urbanity and demographic characteristics. In densely populated cities, park density (parks per 1000 of the population) was associated with reduced suicide mortality among females aged 18 and above and among males aged 18 to 39 and aged 65 and above. In small- and medium-sized cities, park coverage (\% by area) was linked to fewer suicide deaths among middle-aged and older females (aged 40 and above). In contrast, in non-cities (rural areas), parks were not associated with suicide mortality whereas woodland coverage (\% by area) was linked to reduced suicide deaths among middle-aged and older males (aged 40 and above). Our findings suggest that urban green space and rural forest coverage may have a protective effect against self-harming behavior. Future suicide prevention efforts should consider an increased greening of the residential environment in terms of both availability and accessibility, especially with better designs that accommodate population needs and local conditions.},

  abstract = {Introduction Adequate sleep duration and quality are protective against many adverse health outcomes. Many individual-level predictors of poor sleep have been examined, but few studies have examined neighborhood-level influences. Despite known associations between neighborhood green space and sleep influencing factors (eg, physical activity, mental health), few studies have examined green space and sleep's relationship. Furthermore, little work has examined the relationship between the magnitude and type of neighborhood sounds and sleep. Study methods We analyzed data from the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin database (n\,=\,2712) for 2008-2013, a representative sample of Wisconsin residents ages 21-74. Outcomes included weekday and weekend sleep duration and self-rated sleep quality. Primary predictors were the proportion tree canopy (National Land Cover Database) and mean decibel levels of outdoor sound (US National Park Service) at the census block group level. Survey regression analysis was used to examine statistical associations, controlling for individual and neighborhood-level covariates. Results Models suggest a significant relationship (P\,{$<$}\,.05) between weekday sleep duration and green space, and between weekend/day sleep duration and human-made and total neighborhood sound. Increased percent tree canopy in a census block group was associated with lower odds of short weekday sleep ({$<$}6 hours) (OR 0.76 [0.58-0.98]). Increased human-made and total mean decibel levels were associated with increased instances of short weekend and weekday sleep (OR 1.05 [1.01-1.08] and 1.03 [1.01-1.06] respectively). Conclusions Neighborhood tree canopy and sound levels may influence sleep duration and are potential targets for neighborhood-level interventions to improve sleep.},

The purpose of this study was to measure levels of access to public beaches in the Detroit Metropolitan Area (DMA) using four travel distances (1, 6, 10, and 20 miles) and three access measures (minimum distance, travel cost, and covering), with the intent of demonstrating the sensitivity of findings to both the distance and measure employed. Findings indicate that while public beaches are geographically accessible for a majority of the DMA population within 20 miles according to all access measures, at distances less than 20 miles level of access varies substantially with the access measure used. Future access studies should consider a range of travel distances rather than the single distance typical of most prior analyses and should also be sensitive to the differentials produced by the access measure employed.},

  abstract = {Urban planners frequently adhere to `park minimum standards' to ensure that public health and environmental benefits associated with greenspace are socially equitable. These standards denote the extent and placement of greenspaces, but rarely consider their form and function. Arguably, an inclusive evaluation of greenspace social equity requires the comparison of greenspace types. To address if greenspace types are socially equitable, I develop a novel spatial analytic approach that classifies 4265 greenspaces according to twelve functional, physical characteristics. I then compare the social equity of these greenspace types using multiple operationalizations of social equity (provision, accessibility, and population pressure) throughout 4524 neighborhoods in a capital city in Australia. I find that greenspace social equity varies for each of these types. For example, results reveal that affluent households have an abundance of amenity rich greenspaces and few amenity poor ones. Further, by comparing across multiple social equity operationalizations, I find that affluent households may have a deficit of the amenity poor greenspace type, but live closer to this type. These findings confirm that employing a greenspace typology and multiple social equity operationalizations can deepen our understanding of the association between social equity and greenspace provision. This spatial analytic approach is both adaptable for examining other urban land use types, and portable to other urban contexts, and can aid urban planners, researchers, and policy makers to understand how to improve the social equity of publicly beneficial greenspace types.},

We investigated whether being near urban tree cover during outdoor activities was related to being assaulted with a gun. We conducted geographic information systems\textendash assisted interviews with boys and men aged 10\textendash 24 years in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, including 135 patients who had been shot with a firearm and 274 community controls, during 2008\textendash 2011. Each subject reported a step-by-step mapped account of where and with whom they traveled over a full day from waking until being assaulted or going to bed. Geocoded path points were overlaid on mapped layers representing tree locations and place-specific characteristics. Conditional logistic regressions were used to compare case subjects versus controls (case-control) and case subjects at the time of injury versus times earlier that day (case-crossover). When comparing cases at the time of assault to controls matched at the same time of day, being under tree cover was inversely associated with gunshot assault (odds ratio (OR)~=~0.70, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.55, 0.88), especially in low-income areas (OR~=~0.69, 95\% CI: 0.54, 0.87). Case-crossover models confirmed this inverse association overall (OR~=~0.55, 95\% CI: 0.34, 0.89) and in low-income areas (OR~=~0.54, 95\% CI: 0.33, 0.88).

Field research has established that temperatures within parks or beneath trees can be cooler than in non-greenspaces, but little is known about the effects of the spatial pattern of greenspace on urban temperatures or the optimal spatial patterns needed to cool an urban environment. Here, urban cool islands (UCIs) and greenspace in Nanjing, China were identified from satellite data and the relationship between them analyzed using correlation analyses. The results indicate the following: (1) Areas with a higher percentage of forest-vegetation experience a greater cooling effect and a 10\% increase in forest-vegetation area resulted in a decrease of about 0.83\textdegree C in surface temperature; (2) A correlation analysis between mean patch size, patch density, and an aggregation index of forest vegetation with temperature reduction showed that for a fixed amount of forest vegetation, fragmented greenspaces also provide effective cooling; (3) The spatial pattern of UCIs was strongly correlated with greenspace patterns; a mainland-island greenspace spatial configuration provided an efficient means of enhancing the cooling effects; and (4) the intensity of the cooling effect was reflected in cool island characteristics. These findings will support better prediction of the effects of specific amounts and spatial arrangements of greenspace, helping city managers and planners mitigate increasing temperatures associated with climate change.},

A sample of 3060 Finnish people (38.3\% response rate) aged 15\textendash 74 years participated in a survey using an internet and a mail questionnaire. Multiple mediation analysis using bootstrapping revealed an association between the self-reported participation in nature-based recreation and emotional well-being through restorative experiences when adjusting for age, gender, household income, the level of leisure time physical activity, and the frequency of active transportation. The amount of social company or the duration of the most recent nature-based recreation visit did not mediate the association between the average time spent on nature-based recreation and emotional well-being. The result accords with the evidence of the restorative and well-being effects of nature exposure but more evidence of causality and studies comparing different mediators in different population groups are needed.},

Therefore, it is necessary to identify the characteristics of elderly urban residents suffering from mental health issues, to address these issues more effectively. We used 2015 Community Health Survey data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to identify the demographic and social characteristics of 11,408 elderly urban residents in relation to stress levels and symptoms of depression in seven metropolitan areas in Korea, and to calculate the odds ratio for urban green space. We found that the prevalence of these mental health issues generally decreased in relation to the ratio of green space of an area. These findings suggest identifying elderly people who are vulnerable to certain mental health issues based on demographic and social characteristics and demonstrate that the ratio of urban green space within a community is an important component in improving mental health outcomes for elderly urban residents. These findings have policy implications for assisting elderly people vulnerable to certain mental health issues and for establishing a green welfare policy targeting this population.},

Spatial autocorrelation, which comes either from the physical forcing of environmental variables or from community processes, presents a problem for statistical testing because autocorrelated data violate the assumption of independence of most standard statistical procedures. The paper discusses first how autocorrelation in ecological variables can be described and measured, with emphasis on mapping techniques. Then, proper statistical testing in the presence of autocorrelation is briefly discussed. Finally, ways are presented of explicitly introducing spatial structures into ecological models. Two approaches are proposed; in the raw\textemdash data approach, the spatial structure takes the form of a polynomial of the x and y geographic coordinates of the sampling stations; in the matrix approach, the spatial structure is introduced in the form of a geographic distance matrix among locations. These two approaches are compared in the concluding section. A table provides a list of computer programs available for spatial analysis.},

In addition, few studies have investigated how different dimensions of neighbourhood social cohesion mediates the relationship between the natural outdoor environment and mental health. To bridge these gaps, we examined the relationship between neighbourhood natural outdoor environments and individuals' mental health in Guangzhou, China, using a combination of questionnaire survey data, streetscape and remote-sensing metrics, and multilevel structural equation modelling. More particularly, this study explored the mediating effects of three dimensions of neighbourhood social cohesion (i.e. neighbourhood attachment, neighbourly interaction, and community participation). The results indicate that neighbourhood green space and blue space are both positively associated with individuals' mental health. Neighbourhood street greenery exerts beneficial effects on mental health, directly by its visual effect, and indirectly by improving neighbourhood attachment and community participation. Neighbourhood street-view blue space and surrounding green (blue) space also has a positive influence on mental health, but it does so in a direct manner only. This study contributes to our knowledge by estimating the mediating impacts of three dimensions of neighbourhood social cohesion and applying both streetscape and remote-sensing metrics of visible green space and blue space within neighbourhoods.},

Yet empirical studies have almost exclusively focused on parks rather than street, although streets are among the most popular venues for physical activity and street greenery is an indispensable component of urban greenspaces. Even fewer greenspace-physical activity studies have objectively assessed eye-level street greenery. By using free Google Street View images, this study assessed both the quantity and quality of street greenery and associated them with the recreational physical activity occurring in green outdoor environments of 1390 participants in 24 housing estates in Hong Kong. After controlling for socio-demographic characteristics and other built environment factors, multilevel regression models revealed that the quality and quantity of street greenery were positively linked to recreational physical activity. Our finding is important for interpretations of the operational mechanisms between street greenery and health benefits because it demonstrates that physical activity is an intermediate health-related outcome. The findings also reveal the influences of eye-level street greenery on residents' physical activity levels and hence contribute to the development and implementation of healthy cities to stimulate physical activity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a rapidly urbanizing world, many people have little contact with natural environments, which may affect health and well-being. Existing reviews generally conclude that residential greenspace is beneficial to health. However, the processes generating these benefits and how they can be best promoted remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: During an Expert Workshop held in September 2016, the evidence linking greenspace and health was reviewed from a transdisciplinary standpoint, with a particular focus on potential underlying biopsychosocial pathways and how these can be explored and organized to support policy-relevant population health research. DISCUSSIONS: Potential pathways linking greenspace to health are here presented in three domains, which emphasize three general functions of greenspace: reducing harm (e.g. reducing exposure to air pollution, noise and heat), restoring capacities (e.g. attention restoration and physiological stress recovery) and building capacities (e.g. encouraging physical activity and facilitating social cohesion). Interrelations between among the three domains are also noted. Among several recommendations, future studies should: use greenspace and behavioural measures that are relevant to hypothesized pathways; include assessment of presence, access and use of greenspace; use longitudinal, interventional and (quasi)experimental study designs to assess causation; and include low and middle income countries given their absence in the existing literature. Cultural, climatic, geographic and other contextual factors also need further consideration. CONCLUSIONS: While the existing evidence affirms beneficial impacts of greenspace on health, much remains to be learned about the specific pathways and functional form of such relationships, and how these may vary by context, population groups and health outcomes. This Report provides guidance for further epidemiological research with the goal of creating new evidence upon which to develop policy recommendations.},

  abstract = {Introduction Distinctions between rural and urban environments produce different frequencies of traumatic exposures and psychiatric disorders. We examine the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and frequency of trauma exposures by position on the rural-urban continuum. Methods The National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) was used to evaluate psychiatric disorders among a nationally-representative sample of the U.S. population. Rurality was designated using the Department of Agriculture's 2003 rural-urban continuum codes (RUCC), which differentiate counties into levels of rurality by population density and adjacency to metropolitan areas. Lifetime psychiatric disorders included post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, mood disorders, impulse-control disorders, and substance abuse. Trauma exposures were classified as war-related, accident-related, disaster-related, interpersonal or other. Weighted logistic regression models examined the odds of psychiatric disorders and trauma exposures by position on the rural-urban continuum, adjusted for relevant covariates. Results 75\% of participants were metropolitan, 12.2\% were suburban, and 12.8\% were from rural counties. The most common disorder reported was any anxiety disorder (38.5\%). Drug abuse was more common among metropolitan (8.7\%, p = 0.018), compared to nonmetropolitan (5.1\% suburban, 6.1\% rural) participants. A one-category increase in rurality was associated with decreased odds for war-related trauma (aOR = 0.86, 95\%CI 0.78\textendash 0.95). Rurality was not associated with risk for any other lifetime psychiatric disorders or trauma exposure. Discussion/Conclusions Contrary to the expectation of some rural primary care providers, the frequencies of most psychiatric disorders and trauma exposures are similar across the rural-urban continuum, reinforcing calls to improve mental healthcare access in resource-poor rural communities.},

  abstract = {Background The current study explored the association between green space and depression in a deprived, multiethnic sample of pregnant women, and examined moderating and mediating variables. Method 7547 women recruited to the `Born in Bradford' cohort completed a questionnaire during pregnancy. A binary measure of depressive symptoms was calculated using a validated survey. Two green space measures were used: quintiles of residential greenness calculated using the normalised difference vegetation index for three neighbourhood sizes (100, 300 and 500 m buffer zones around participant addresses); access to major green spaces estimated as straight line distance between participant address and nearest green space ({$>$}0.5 hectares). Logistic regression analyses examined relationships between green space and depressive symptoms, controlling for ethnicity, demographics, socioeconomic status (SES) and health behaviours. Multiplicative interactions explored variations by ethnic group, SES or activity levels. Mediation analysis assessed indirect effects via physical activity. Results Pregnant women in the greener quintiles were 18\textendash 23\% less likely to report depressive symptoms than those in the least green quintile (for within 100 m of green space buffer zone). The green space-depressive symptoms association was significant for women with lower education or who were active. Physical activity partially mediated the association of green space, but explained only a small portion of the direct effect. Conclusions Higher residential greenness was associated with a reduced likelihood of depressive symptoms. Associations may be stronger for more disadvantaged groups and for those who are already physically active. Improving green space is a promising intervention to reduce risk of depression in disadvantaged groups.},

  abstract = {Urban greenspace can provide physical and mental health benefits to residents, potentially reducing health inequalities associated with socioeconomic deprivation. The distribution of urban greenspace is an important social justice issue, and consequently is increasingly studied. However, there is little consistency between studies in terms of methods and definitions. There is no consensus on what comprises the most appropriate geographic units of analysis or how to capture residents\&rsquo; experience of their neighbourhood, leading to the possibility of bias. Several complementary aspects of distribution equity have been defined, yet few studies investigate more than one of these. There are also alternative methods for measuring each aspect of distribution. All of these can lead to conflicting conclusions, which we demonstrate by calculating three aspects of equity for two units of aggregation and three neighbourhood sizes for a single study area. We make several methodological recommendations, including taking steps to capture the relevant neighbourhood as experienced by residents accurately as possible, and suggest that using small-area aggregations may not result in unacceptable levels of information loss. However, a consideration of the local context is critical both in interpreting individual studies and understanding differing results.},

Using metrics identified in this process to describe the composition and configuration of urban greenspace, we conduct a small-area epidemiological analysis of self-reported general health for the city of Sheffield, UK. A relatively high proportion of water cover and a high diversity of tree planting are associated with lower levels of poor health; while a high proportion of grass cover, which may be indicative of low quality greenspaces, is associated with higher levels. The presence of large greenspace patches that are well interspersed with the built environment is also associated with lower levels of poor health. We demonstrate a successful methodology for identifying useful landscape metrics even where effect sizes are small, and explore the challenges of translating results of landscape metric studies into policy guidance.},

  abstract = {Urban greenspace is a valuable component of the urban form that has the potential to improve the health and well-being of residents. Most quantitative studies of relationships between health and greenspace to date have investigated associations only with what greenspace exists in the local environment (i.e. provision of greenspace), rather than to what extent it is used. This is due to the difficulty of obtaining usage data in large amounts. In recent years, GPS functionality integrated into mobile phones has provided a potential solution to this problem by making it possible to track which parts of the environment people experience in their day-to-day lives. In this paper, we demonstrate a method to derive cleaned, trip-level information from raw GPS data collected by a mobile phone app, then use this data to investigate the characteristics of trips to urban greenspace by residents of the city of Sheffield, UK. We find that local users of the app spend an average of an hour per week visiting greenspaces, including around seven trips per week and covering a total distance of just over 2.5 km. This may be enough to provide health benefits, but is insufficient to provide maximal benefits. Trip characteristics vary with user demographics: ethnic minority users and users from more socioeconomically deprived areas tend to make shorter trips than White users and those from less deprived areas, while users aged 34 years and over make longer trips than younger users. Women, on average, make more frequent trips than men, as do those who spent more time outside as a child. Our results suggest that most day-to-day greenspace visits are incidental, i.e. travelling through rather than to greenspace, and highlight the importance of including social and cultural factors when investigating who uses and who benefits from urban greenspace.},

We compare the findings with participation (yes/no) in physical exercise/workouts. A survey (N = 780) was conducted in the Norwegian town Moss. We used linear regression models to assess the potential links between the frequency of walks from home and the following self-reported indicators: income, education, housing type, employment, age, gender, raised in Norway or not, years of residence in Moss, number of financial household providers, household with/without children, exerciser or not, activity level at work, perceived health status, sedentary minutes per week, and dog ownership. The study reveals that neighbourhood walking appeals to all adults regardless of demographic situation or socio-economic position. Furthermore, owning a dog seems to be a successful factor for getting people to walk. Our results show a higher frequency of walks from home for transport than for the walk itself (usually called recreational walks). Given the global political health goal of encouraging people to be more physically active, this study demonstrates the potential of walking from a public health perspective. The study argues for the importance of health promoting urban planning, with attractive and walkable friendly urban environments. Furthermore, the study acknowledges the importance of promoting a broader understanding of outdoor recreation in urban settings, where neighbourhood walking, both for recreation and for transport, should be regarded as an activity within the frame of urban recreation. Management implications \textbullet Neighbourhood walking appeals to all adults regardless of demographic situation or socio-economic position.\textbullet Young adults and people who are better economically situated favour physical exercise more than other adults do.\textbullet In a world dominated by inactive adults, a moderate physical activity such as neighbourhood walking has great potential to improve public health.\textbullet Public health policy and management should facilitate efficient measures to stimulate neighbourhood walking.\textbullet Neighbourhood walking, both for recreation and for transport, should be regarded as an activity within the frame of urban recreation; both types are mostly performed in people's leisure time.\textbullet It is important to base urban planning on the principle of developing a walkable city.},

A cross-sectional examination of the relationship between access to urban green spaces and counts of anxiety/mood disorder treatments amongst residents (aged 15 years and over) in Auckland City, New Zealand. Anxiety/mood disorder treatment counts by three age groups were aggregated to 3149 small area units in Auckland. Six measures of green space access were derived using GIS techniques involving total green spaces and useable green spaces. Negative binomial regression models have been fitted to test the relationship between access to green space and area-level anxiety/mood disorder treatment counts, adjusted for age and area-level deprivation. Anxiety/mood disorder treatment counts were associated with three green space measures. The proportion of both total and useable green space within 3 km and distance to nearest useable green space all indicated a protective effect of increased access to green space against anxiety/mood disorder treatment counts. Access to total and useable green space within 300 m did not exhibit significant associations. This study found that decreased distance to useable green space and increased proportion of green space within the larger neighbourhood were associated with decreased anxiety/mood disorder treatment counts in an urban environment. This suggests the benefits of green space on mental health may relate both to active participation in useable green spaces near to the home and observable green space in the neighbourhood environment.},

  abstract = {EXECUTIVE SUMMARY. Despite pervasive beliefs about the association between outdoor recreation and positive health outcomes, empirical evidence remains largely inconclusive. Past research has focused primarily on the individual and community level and revealed both strong connections between physical activity and health and proximity to public parks predict physical activity levels. Evidence connecting outdoor recreation opportunities directly with specific health outcomes (e.g., weight status, diabetes, mental health), however, is limited. Furthermore, only a handful of studies explores connections between outdoor recreation opportunities and health at macro levels (e.g., across states, counties, or metropolitan areas). Macro-level studies to date have limited analysis to physical activity and obesity rates, despite the wide range of benefits associated with physical activity. This study expands the macro-level understanding of the connection between the availability of outdoor recreation, physical activity, and health by using a typology of recreation opportunities and analyzing a wider range of health outcomes at a county level in the U.S. state of Minnesota. Results suggest that although parkland and nonmotorized trails significantly and positively associate with increased physical activity and lower obesity rates, most other health associations remain insignificant when controlling for select sociodemographic characteristics. Results imply the importance of readily available recreation opportunities in fostering physically active lifestyles, suggest a larger variety of recreation indicators be included in future analysis and inventories, and highlight opportunities for public lands to encourage and promote physical activity.},

  abstract = {Study objective Prolonged boarding times in the emergency department (ED) disproportionately affect mental health patients, resulting in patient and provider dissatisfaction and increased patient morbidity and mortality. Our objective is to quantify the burden of mental health boarding and to elucidate the effect of insurance together with demographic, social, and comorbid factors on length of stay. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional observational study of 871 consecutive patients requiring an ED mental health evaluation at one of 10 unaffiliated Massachusetts hospitals. Demographics; insurance; length of stay; medical, psychiatric, and social history; and disposition data were collected. We evaluated the effect of these characteristics on boarding time. Results ED median length of stay varied greatly by disposition, driven primarily by ED boarding time. Admitted and transferred patients had longer delays than discharged patients (5.63, 9.32, and 1.23 hours, respectively). Medical clearance time (1.40 hours) composed only 10.5\% of total ED length of stay and varied little by insurance. In our multivariate analyses, patients with Medicaid and the uninsured had significantly longer total lengths of stay and were more than twice as likely to remain in the ED for 24 hours or greater compared with privately insured patients. Conclusion Mental health patients in Massachusetts have lengthy ED visits, particularly those requiring inpatient admission. Boarding time accounts for the majority of total ED length of stay and varies by insurance, even when other factors known to affect ED length of stay are controlled. Efforts to improve timeliness of care for mental health emergencies should focus on reducing ED boarding and eliminating disparities in care by insurance status.},

  abstract = {By the 1990s, sociology faced a frustrating paradox. Classic work on mental illness stigma and labeling theory reinforced that the ``mark'' of mental illness created prejudice and discrimination for individuals and family members. Yet that foundation, coupled with deinstitutionalization of mental health care, produced contradictory responses. Claims that stigma was dissipating were made, while others argued that intervention efforts were needed to reduce stigma. While signaling the critical role of theory-based research in establishing the pervasive effects of stigma, both claims directed resources away from social science research. Yet the contemporary scientific foundation underlying both claims was weak. A reply came in a resurgence of research directed toward mental illness stigma nationally and internationally, bringing together researchers from different disciplines for the first time. I report on the general population's attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral dispositions that targeted public stigma and implications for the next decade of research and intervention efforts.},

  abstract = {******These data are preliminary or provisional and are subject to revision. They are being provided to meet the need for timely best science. The data have not received final approval by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and are provided on the condition that neither the USGS nor the U.S. Government shall be held liable for any damages resulting from the authorized or unauthorized use of the data. The USGS Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) is the nation's inventory of protected areas, including public land and voluntarily provided private protected areas, identified as an A-16 National Geospatial Data Asset in the Cadastre Theme (https://communities.geoplatform.gov/ngda-cadastre/). The PAD-US is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database including areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural (including extraction), recreational, or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The database was originally designed to support biodiversity assessments; however, its scope expanded in recent years to include all public and nonprofit lands and waters. Most are public lands owned in fee (the owner of the property has full and irrevocable ownership of the land); however, long-term easements, leases, agreements, Congressional (e.g. 'Wilderness Area'), Executive (e.g. 'National Monument'), and administrative designations (e.g. 'Area of Critical Environmental Concern') documented in agency management plans are also included. The PAD-US strives to be a complete inventory of public land and other protected areas, compiling ?best available? data provided by managing agencies and organizations. The PAD-US geodatabase maps and describes areas using over twenty-five attributes and five feature classes representing the U.S. protected areas network in separate feature classes: Fee (ownership parcels), Designation, Easement, Marine, Proclamation and Other Planning Boundaries. Five additional feature classes include various combinations of the primary layers (for example, Combined\_Fee\_Easement) to support data management, queries, web mapping services, and analyses. This PAD-US Version 2.1 dataset includes a variety of updates and new data from the previous Version 2.0 dataset (USGS, 2018 https://doi.org/10.5066/P955KPLE ), achieving the primary goal to \&amp;amp;quot;Complete the PAD-US Inventory by 2020\&amp;amp;quot; (https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/science-analytics-and-synthesis/gap/science/pad-us-vision) by addressing known data gaps with newly available data. The following list summarizes the integration of \&amp;amp;quot;best available\&amp;amp;quot; spatial data to ensure public lands and other protected areas from all jurisdictions are represented in PAD-US, along with continued improvements and regular maintenance of the federal theme. Completing the PAD-US Inventory: 1) Integration of over 75,000 city parks in all 50 States (and the District of Columbia) from The Trust for Public Land's (TPL) ParkServe data development initiative (https://parkserve.tpl.org/) added nearly 2.7 million acres of protected area and significantly reduced the primary known data gap in previous PAD-US versions (local government lands). 2) First-time integration of the Census American Indian/Alaskan Native Areas (AIA) dataset (https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2019/AIANNH) representing the boundaries for federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands across the nation (as of January 1, 2020, as reported by the federally recognized tribal governments through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey) addressed another major PAD-US data gap. 3) Aggregation of nearly 5,000 protected areas owned by local land trusts in 13 states, aggregated by Ducks Unlimited through data calls for easements to update the National Conservation Easement Database (https://www.conservationeasement.us/), increased PAD-US protected areas by over 350,000 acres. Maintaining regular Federal updates: 1) Major update of the Federal estate (fee ownership parcels, easement interest, and management designations), including authoritative data from 8 agencies: Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Census Bureau (Census), Department of Defense (DOD), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service (NPS), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), U.S. Forest Service (USFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The federal theme in PAD-US is developed in close collaboration with the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Federal Lands Working Group (FLWG, https://communities.geoplatform.gov/ngda-govunits/federal-lands-workgroup/); 2) Complete National Marine Protected Areas (MPA) update: from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) MPA Inventory, including conservation measure ('GAP Status Code', 'IUCN Category') review by NOAA; Other changes: 1) PAD-US field name change - The \&amp;amp;quot;Public Access\&amp;amp;quot; field name changed from 'Access' to 'Pub\_Access' to avoid unintended scripting errors associated with the script command 'access'. 2) Additional field - The \&amp;amp;quot;Feature Class\&amp;amp;quot; (FeatClass) field was added to all layers within PAD-US 2.1 (only included in the \&amp;amp;quot;Combined\&amp;amp;quot; layers of PAD-US 2.0 to describe which feature class data originated from). 3) Categorical GAP Status Code default changes - National Monuments are categorically assigned GAP Status Code = 2 (previously GAP 3), in the absence of other information, to better represent biodiversity protection restrictions associated with the designation. The Bureau of Land Management Areas of Environmental Concern (ACECs) are categorically assigned GAP Status Code = 3 (previously GAP 2) as the areas are administratively protected, not permanent. More information is available upon request. 4) Agency Name (FWS) geodatabase domain description changed to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (previously U.S. Fish \&amp;amp;amp; Wildlife Service).

Both human and environmental factors can induce NTDs, but various studies ignored contextual effects. This research examines whether there are significant soil type contextual effects on the rate of NTDs. A spatial two-level regression model is used to quantify the magnitude of contextual effects. Spatial autocorrelated errors structure is used to control autocorrelation of residuals. The results suggest that the spatial multilevel model fit the data better than non-spatial multilevel models. Our findings indicate that there are significant soil type contextual effects on the rate of NTDs, even after taking into account of fertilizer and net income. More attentions should be focused on how characteristics of each soil type may affect the rates of NTDs in further studies, which is a relevant issue for understanding etiology of NTDs.},

  abstract = {A growing body of research shows affluent White neighborhoods have more acres of parks and more park facilities than low-income ethnic minority communities in many Global North cities. Most of these investigations focused on neighborhood-level differences and did not analyze broader inequities across cities. This is a particularly significant limitation in the U.S., where changes in the political economy of parks due to a reduced local tax base have led cities to compete against each other to secure park funding from national nonprofits and public agencies. To address this gap, we examined whether the quality of urban park systems \textendash{} measured through The Trust for Public Land's ParkScore \textendash{} varies depending on a city's median income and ethnic composition. Based on multivariate regressions in which we control for features of the urban fabric, we found U.S. cities with higher median incomes and lower percentages of Latino and Non-Hispanic Black residents have higher ParkScores than other cities. Some inequities also emerged for park coverage, park spending per person, and park facilities, with majority-Latino cities being particularly disadvantaged. These findings echo the results of neighborhood-level studies in Global North contexts, suggesting neighborhood-level inequities in park provision might scale up to inequities across cities. This study contributes to environmental justice theory and advocacy by demonstrating the importance of scaling up analyses of park provision to cross-city comparisons. Implications for landscape planning, public policy, and grant-making are discussed.},

These initiatives can result in greener landscapes in marginalized communities, but we know little about the spatial patterns of vacant land disposition and whether demand for and sale of publicly-owned lots are stronger in gentrifying neighborhoods. We examined the Chicago Large Lot Program and used neighborhood sociodemographic, environmental, and safety factors to predict the demand and sale of vacant lots. We found that the demand for Large Lots was significantly higher in tracts showing early signs of gentrification between 2000 and 2015 (those with higher increases of college graduates and White residents) and for tracts located closer to downtown. Also, the percentage of Large Lots sold was significantly larger in areas closer to downtown and farther from Lake Michigan but not associated with gentrification, which might be due to neighborhood political forces seeking to retain public control of vacant lots in gentrifying neighborhoods. Although other studies show that urban greening precedes gentrification, our findings suggest that the demand for urban greening might also follow early gentrification.},

  abstract = {Urban greenspace is often associated with improved mental health, particularly in urban areas, with studies typically carried out at town or city scales. Population level models enable us to extend the understanding of the relationship between mental health and urban greenspace to the national level, with relevance to national level policy and funding decision making. We used linear mixed effects models to investigate the relationship between urban greenspace availability measured at two scales (immediate neighbourhood and within 30 min walk) and prescription rates to treat mental health disorders across all Scottish settlements with over 10,000 residents. We incorporated socio-demographic and area-level covariates shown to be related to mental health and/or greenspace use and corrected for spatial autocorrelation and potential impacts of health boards. Within the immediate neighbourhood we estimated a significant relationship between mental health and urban greenspace in areas with high proportions of individuals identifying as part of a Black and Minority Ethnic group and/or a high proportion of households deprived in more than two dimensions. In these areas higher greenspace was associated with lower prescription rates. When considering greenspace within 30 min walk, no significant relationship was estimated between greenspace and mental health disorders. Our results highlight that the relationship between greenspace and mental health relies not only on the presence of greenspace itself, but also on the characteristics of the population using the greenspace. Although aggregated secondary data does not allow us to make inferences around an individual's relationship to greenspace, population level models as presented here provide valuable information to urban and land use planning, where decisions are taken at the population level.},

The objective of this retrospective birth cohort study was to examine the association between residential exposure to greenspace and adverse pregnancy health outcomes in a Southern US state characterized by high poverty and racial disparities in maternal health (2013\textendash 2017). National data from the Protected Area database \textendash{} United States (PAD-US) and ParkServe estimated three publicly available and accessible residential greenspace measures\textemdash a more direct proxy than using remotely-sensed greenness indicators (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI))\textemdash (a) percent area of greenspace (M1), (b) area of available greenspace per person (M2), (c) total population within a 10-minute walk (M3). Generalized Estimating Equations with logistic regression were used to examine the association between individual greenspace metrics and South Carolina hospital deliveries (n~=~238,922 deliveries) for women with correlated maternal health outcomes for gestational hypertension (GHTN), gestational diabetes (GD), severe maternal morbidity (SMM), preeclampsia (PRE), mental disorders (MD), depressive disorders (DD), and preterm birth (PTB). Lowest compared to highest tertiles of all three metrics were associated with increased risk for MD, DD, and a monotonic increase in GD, particularly for black women. Women with the lowest access to M2 and M3 were more at risk for PRE, PTB, and MD. We observed that women in low-income, majority-black communities in the lowest versus highest tertile of M2 were more likely to experience a DD, MD, SMM, or PTB compared to primarily high-income majority-white communities. Available and accessible green/park space may present as an effective nature-based intervention to reduce maternal complications, particularly for gestational diabetes and other pregnancy health risks for which there are currently few known evidence-based primary prevention strategies.},

Depression is the most common mental disorder in the world, but it is unclear how urbanization and urban living affect depression outcomes. Grounded in a previously articulated conceptual framework, we systematically reviewed recently published studies on urbanization, urbanicity, and depression. RECENT FINDINGS: Eleven articles were included in this review. Four studies found that living in urban areas was associated with elevated odds or more symptoms of depression. Three studies - all done in China - estimated protective effects of urbanization or urbanicity on depression. Two studies concluded no overall clear association. The remaining two articles stratified by urbanicity and found that greenspace was inversely associated with depression in more densely populated areas relative to rural areas. Other themes discussed included global and national trends such as aging, immigration, and planned urbanization in China, as well as urban living conditions such as traffic noise, air pollution, proximity to roadways, neighborhood social capital, and social cohesion. SUMMARY: Urbanization may affect depression differentially across geographic regions and income levels. More research is needed, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries, and on intersections between urbanization and other emerging global trends.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased urbanisation and the associated reduced contact of individuals with natural environments have led to a rise in mental disorders, including depression. Residential greenness, a fundamental component of urban design, has been shown to reduce the public health burden of mental disorders. The present study investigates the association between residential green exposure and prevalence of major depressive disorders using a large and diverse cross-sectional dataset from the UK Biobank. METHODS: In this cross-sectional, observational, associational study, we used baseline data from the UK Biobank cohort of participants aged 37-73 years from across the UK. Environmental exposure data were derived from a modelled and linked built environment database. Residential greenness was assessed with a 0{$\cdot$}5 m resolution Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, which is derived from spectral reflectance measurements in remotely sensed colour infrared data and measured within geocoded dwelling catchments. Other environment metrics included street-level movement density, terrain, and fine particulate exposures. A series of logistic models examined associations between residential greenness and odds of major depressive disorder after adjusting for activity-influencing environments and individual covariates. FINDINGS: Of 122\hphantom{,}993 participants with data on major depressive disorder, the study analytical sample comprised 94\hphantom{,}879 (77{$\cdot$}1\%) participants recruited across ten UK Biobank assessment centres between April 29, 2009, and Oct 1, 2010. A protective effect of greenness on depression was consistently observed, with 4{$\cdot$}0\% lower odds of major depressive disorder per interquartile increment in Normalised Difference Vegetation Index greenness (odds ratio 0{$\cdot$}960, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}93-0{$\cdot$}99; p=0{$\cdot$}0044). Interaction analyses indicated that the beneficial effects of greenness were more pronounced among women, participants younger than 60 years, and participants residing in areas with low neighbourhood socioeconomic status or high urbanicity. INTERPRETATION: The results point to the benefits of well designed green environments on mental health. Further longitudinal studies are needed to decipher causal pathways. In the UK, policies aimed at optimising allocation and design of green spaces might help preserve psychological ecosystem services, thereby, improving the mental wellbeing of populations and enhancing the mental capital of cities.

The purpose of this systematic review was to 1) explore research related to green space and sleep, and 2) examine the impact of green space exposure on sleep quality and quantity. Papers from eight electronic databases were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: well-designed, any analysis exploring green space and sleep, provided sleep and green space measurement, published in peer-reviewed journals, and written in English. Thirteen eligible studies related to green space and sleep were selected after peer-review procedures. Cross-sectional studies (n~=~7) used either a questionnaire or the combination of Geographic Information Systems and remote sensing images for green space measurement, while questionnaires were primarily used to measure both sleep quality and quantity. Intervention studies (n~=~5) were categorized into three types: walking program, gardening, and working in a forest. Eleven out of thirteen studies concluded that green space exposure was associated with improvement in both sleep quality and quantity. The findings support the evidence of a positive association between green space exposures and sleep quality and quantity, and also suggest green exercise and therapeutic gardening as possible intervention methods to improve sleep outcomes.},

  abstract = {Since the burden of chronic diseases is rising globally, there is an urgent need to develop population-level approaches to reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Neighborhood environments, where people spend much of their time, are relevant in this context because they can influence residents' daily behaviors related to health. In particular, public green spaces (PGS) can confer health benefits through facilitating physical activity, contact with nature, and social interaction. PGS may also mitigate socio-economic inequalities in health. However, despite growing evidence, PGS are generally not fully utilized as a resource for physical activity. Thus, there is substantial scope for enhancing population health through increased visits and active use of PGS. This essay argues that PGS are not only health-enhancing but also practical and workable environmental resources to promote population health. We discuss three ``advantages'' of using PGS as health promotion initiatives: PGS are easier to modify (than are other structural environmental features); PGS can involve programs to help residents initiate physical activity; and PGS are valued by residents. The essay concludes with a discussion of future research topics, the result of which can be used to convince and assist local authorities and other key stakeholders to use PGS as readily available resources for health promotion.},

  abstract = {Background Proximity to public open space, such as parks and other green spaces, has considerable health benefits, and people have been shown to be more likely to use such space for physical activity if it is of high quality. This paper describes a new remote-assessment approach that makes use of Google Earth Pro (the free version of this program is Google Earth) to provide rapid and inexpensive measurement of the quality of public open space. Purpose The aim of the study was to assess the correlation between assessments of the quality of public open space using (1) the remote method (making use of Google Earth Pro) and (2) direct observation with a well-established measure of quality, the Public Open Space Tool (POST). Methods Fifty parks selected from the southwest part of Sydney, Australia, were assessed in 2009 with the remote method (using Google Earth Pro), and scores were compared with those obtained from direct observation of the same parks using POST. The time taken to conduct the assessments using each method was also recorded. Raters for each method were blind to scores obtained from using the other method. Analyses were conducted in 2009. Results The Spearman correlation coefficient between the quality scores obtained for the 50 parks using the remote method and direct observation was 0.9 (p{$<$}0.0001). The remote method took 4 hours, whereas direct observation took 42 hours, showing the remote method to be much faster and more resource efficient for the measurement of the quality of physical activity\textendash related environments. Conclusions The remote-assessment method provides, for the first time, the capacity to assess the quality of large numbers of parks and other green spaces without the need for in-person visits, dramatically reducing the time required for environmental audits of public open space.},

  abstract = {Our objective was to compare the effects on mental and physical wellbeing, health related quality of life and long-term adherence to physical activity, of participation in physical activity in natural environments compared with physical activity indoors. We conducted a systematic review using the following data sources: Medline, Embase, Psychinfo, GreenFILE, SportDISCUS, The Cochrane Library, Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index, Arts and Humanities Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index--Science and BIOSIS from inception to June 2010. Internet searches of relevant Web sites, hand searches of relevant journals, and the reference lists of included papers and other review papers identified in the search were also searched for relevant information. Controlled trials (randomized and nonrandomized) were included. To be eligible trials had to compare the effects of outdoor exercise initiatives with those conducted indoors and report on at least one physical or mental wellbeing outcome in adults or children. Screening of articles for inclusion, data extraction, and quality appraisal were performed by one reviewer and checked by a second with discrepancies resolved by discussion with a third if necessary. Due to the heterogeneity of identified studies a narrative synthesis was performed. Eleven trials (833 adults) were included. Most participants (6 trials; 523 adults) were young students. Study entry criteria and methods were sparsely reported. All interventions consisted of a single episode of walking or running indoors with the same activity at a similar level conducted outdoors on a separate occasion. A total of 13 different outcome measures were used to evaluate the effects of exercise on mental wellbeing, and 4 outcome measures were used to assess attitude to exercise. Most trials (n = 9) showed some improvement in mental wellbeing on one or other of the outcome measures. Compared with exercising indoors, exercising in natural environments was associated with greater feelings of revitalization and positive engagement, decreases in tension, confusion, anger, and depression, and increased energy. However, the results suggested that feelings of calmness may be decreased following outdoor exercise. Participants reported greater enjoyment and satisfaction with outdoor activity and declared a greater intent to repeat the activity at a later date. None of the identified studies measured the effects of physical activity on physical wellbeing or the effect of natural environments on exercise adherence. The hypothesis that there are added beneficial effects to be gained from performing physical activity outdoors in natural environments is very appealing and has generated considerable interest. This review has shown some promising effects on self-reported mental wellbeing immediately following exercise in nature which are not seen following the same exercise indoors. However, the interpretation and extrapolation of these findings is hampered by the poor methodological quality of the available evidence and the heterogeneity of outcome measures employed. The review demonstrates the paucity of high quality evidence on which to base recommendations and reveals an undoubted need for further research in this area. Large, well designed, longer term trials in populations who might benefit most from the potential advantages of outdoor exercise are needed to fully elucidate the effects on mental and physical wellbeing. The influence of these effects on the sustainability of physical activity initiatives also awaits investigation.},

  abstract = {Non-motorized outdoor recreation contributes significantly to the U.S. economy by providing over six million jobs and \$88 billion in federal and state tax revenues (Southwick Associates, 2013). Participation in non-motorized wildland recreation, defined in this paper as non-motorized outdoor recreation that is dependent on the natural resources of an undeveloped natural setting, has increased in recent years with half of Americans participating annually (Outdoor Foundation, 2017). There has been a growing field of evidence demonstrating the relationship between natural settings and human health (e.g., Frumkin, 2001). This research suggests that the qualities and characteristics of setting may enhance or inhibit health outcomes (e.g., Kellert, Heerwagen, \& Mador, 2011). Wildland settings (e.g., national parks, national forests, refuges) have unique characteristics that are thought to contribute to human health through the activities that take place in these settings. Similar to the components outlined by Hammitt, Cole, and Monz (2015), our study focuses on wildland recreation and explores the potential relationships between recreation on wildlands and physical and mental health. To date, there has not been a comprehensive and systematic review of the literature exploring how recreation that takes place in wildland settings influences physical and mental health and if these health outcomes differ from recreation in other more urban and exurban outdoor settings (e.g., urban green space). This is particularly important because society faces a range of chronic and acute health challenges and many argue that outdoor recreation in wildland settings offers an important antidote to many of these health challenges. Yet, without investigating and summarizing the results of peer-reviewed investigations, we have little understanding of the potential for wildland recreation improving mental and physical health. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed empirical studies of wildland recreation activities and assessed physical and mental health outcomes. We investigated whether wildland recreation positively contributed to a range of physical and mental health outcomes, the type of recreation activity, where the activity occurred, and if outcomes were positive, why the health benefit occurred. Our analysis explores aspects and focus areas wildland recreation health research (i.e., most studies focused on hiking; how recreational activities impact mental and physical health; and aspects of the physical setting, the recreational activity, and the social atmosphere that influence health). We discuss these trends and outline recommendations for future research to expand our understanding of the linkages between wildland recreation and human health. Our research has implications for managers and researchers. For researchers studying the connections between wildland recreation and human health, this review facilitated identification of trends and gaps which can inform and strengthen this area of research. For managers of wildlands and individuals working to address physical and mental health, our study offers empirical evidence of the connections between wildlands and human health, and can inform how best to manage such lands to promote health benefits.},

Higher residential surrounding greenspace was associated with a lower risk of somatization and anxiety symptoms. For General Severity Index (GSI), obsessive\textendash compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism symptoms, we generally observed protective associations, but none attained statistical significance.

Although much evidence suggests greenspace exposure is beneficial for health, there exists no systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesise and quantify the impact of greenspace on a wide range of health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To quantify evidence of the impact of greenspace on a wide range of health outcomes. METHODS: We searched five online databases and reference lists up to January 2017. Studies satisfying a priori eligibility criteria were evaluated independently by two authors. RESULTS: We included 103 observational and 40 interventional studies investigating \textasciitilde 100 health outcomes. Meta-analysis results showed increased greenspace exposure was associated with decreased salivary cortisol -0.05 (95\% CI -0.07, -0.04), heart rate -2.57 (95\% CI -4.30, -0.83), diastolic blood pressure -1.97 (95\% CI -3.45, -0.19), HDL cholesterol -0.03 (95\% CI -0.05, {$<$}-0.01), low frequency heart rate variability (HRV) -0.06 (95\% CI -0.08, -0.03) and increased high frequency HRV 91.87 (95\% CI 50.92, 132.82), as well as decreased risk of preterm birth 0.87 (95\% CI 0.80, 0.94), type II diabetes 0.72 (95\% CI 0.61, 0.85), all-cause mortality 0.69 (95\% CI 0.55, 0.87), small size for gestational age 0.81 (95\% CI 0.76, 0.86), cardiovascular mortality 0.84 (95\% CI 0.76, 0.93), and an increased incidence of good self-reported health 1.12 (95\% CI 1.05, 1.19). Incidence of stroke, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, asthma, and coronary heart disease were reduced. For several non-pooled health outcomes, between 66.7\% and 100\% of studies showed health-denoting associations with increased greenspace exposure including neurological and cancer-related outcomes, and respiratory mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Greenspace exposure is associated with numerous health benefits in intervention and observational studies. These results are indicative of a beneficial influence of greenspace on a wide range of health outcomes. However several meta-analyses results are limited by poor study quality and high levels of heterogeneity. Green prescriptions involving greenspace use may have substantial benefits. Our findings should encourage practitioners and policymakers to give due regard to how they can create, maintain, and improve existing accessible greenspaces in deprived areas. Furthermore the development of strategies and interventions for the utilisation of such greenspaces by those who stand to benefit the most.},

This systematic review aims to provide an overview of observational studies assessing the association between empirical green space exposure with standardized outcome measures of mental health problems, mental well-being and developmental problems in children, adolescents and young adults. The PRISMA statement guidelines for reporting systematic reviews were followed. A PubMed and Scopus search resulted in the inclusion of 21 studies. The evidence consistently suggests a beneficial association between green space exposure and children's emotional and behavioral difficulties, particularly with hyperactivity and inattention problems. Limited evidence suggests a beneficial association with mental well-being in children and depressive symptoms in adolescents and young adults. These beneficial associations are resistant to adjustment for demographic and socio-economic confounders, which thus may represent independent links. Mediating factors and the variability of this association between different age groups are discussed. From a precautionary principle, evidence up to now demands the attention of policy makers, urban planners and mental healthcare workers in order to protect children's and adolescents' mental health in light of rapid global urbanization by providing sufficient exposure to green spaces.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous research shows a positive link between the amount of green area in one's residential neighbourhood and self-reported health. However, little research has been done on the quality of the green area, as well as on quantity and quality of smaller natural elements in the streetscape. This study investigates the link between the objectively assessed quantity and quality of (1) green areas and (2) streetscape greenery on the one hand and three self-reported health indicators on the other. METHODS: 80 Dutch urban neighbourhoods were selected, varying in the amount of nearby green area per dwelling, as determined by Geographic Information System analysis. The quality of green areas, as well as the quantity and quality of streetscape greenery, was assessed by observers using an audit tool. Residents of each neighbourhood were asked to complete a questionnaire on their own health (N=1641). In multilevel regression analyses, we examined the relationship between greenspace indicators and three health indicators, controlling for socio-demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. RESULTS: Both indicators for the quantity of greenspace were positively related to all three health indicators. Quantity and quality indicators were substantially correlated in the case of streetscape greenery. Nevertheless, the quality indicators tended to have added predictive value for the health indicators, given that the quantity information was already included in the model. CONCLUSIONS: The quantity and also the quality of greenspace in one's neighbourhood seem relevant with regard to health. Furthermore, streetscape greenery is at least as strongly related to self-reported health as green areas.},

Methods: Participants completed repeated assessments of attentiveness, mood, depression, anxiety, and somatic stress across 3 time periods, corresponding to 2 weeks before the trip (baseline), the last day of the trip, and a 6-week follow-up. Assessments of perceptual stress, PTSD symptoms, and sleep quality were also administered during the baseline and follow-up periods. Results: Acute effects were observed for improvements in attentiveness and positive mood states, coupled with significant and sustained reductions in negative mood states, anxiety, depression, and somatic symptoms of stress. Comparisons between the baseline and follow-up periods revealed significant improvements in sleep quality and reductions in perceptual stress and PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: The current findings suggest that combat veterans with PTSD may benefit from participation in group-based outdoor recreation as a means to improve psychosocial well-being.},

  abstract = {Significance             COVID-19 has created a mortality shock throughout the world, and it may yield a second wave of population health concerns tied to bereavement and social support reductions. We created the COVID-19 bereavement multiplier, an indicator that clarifies one downstream impact of COVID-19 mortality and can be applied to different epidemiological projections of death counts: How many people are at risk for losing a grandparent, parent, sibling, spouse, or child for each COVID-19 death. In the United States, we estimate that on average, under diverse epidemiological circumstances, every death from COVID-19 will leave approximately nine bereaved. Studying how acute mortality crises reverberate through a population in the form of bereavement multipliers expands understandings of the social impacts of health crises.           ,              The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a large increase in mortality in the United States and around the world, leaving many grieving the sudden loss of family members. We created an indicator\textemdash the COVID-19 bereavement multiplier\textemdash that estimates the average number of individuals who will experience the death of a close relative (defined as a grandparent, parent, sibling, spouse, or child) for each COVID-19 death. Using demographic microsimulation-based estimates of kinship networks in the United States, the clear age gradient in COVID-19 mortality seen across contexts, and several hypothetical infection prevalence scenarios, we estimate COVID-19 bereavement multipliers for White and Black individuals in the United States. Our analysis shows that for every COVID-19 death, approximately nine surviving Americans will lose a grandparent, parent, sibling, spouse, or child. These estimates imply, for example, that if 190,000 Americans die from COVID-19, as some models project, then {$\sim$}1.7 million will experience the death of a close relative. We demonstrate that our estimates of the bereavement multiplier are stable across epidemiological realities, including infection scenarios, total number of deaths, and the distribution of deaths, which means researchers can estimate the bereavement burden over the course of the epidemic in lockstep with rising death tolls. In addition, we provide estimates of bereavement multipliers by age group, types of kin loss, and race to illuminate prospective disparities. The bereavement multiplier is a useful indicator for tracking COVID-19's multiplicative impact as it reverberates across American families and can be tailored to other causes of death.},

  abstract = {Residential greenspace quality may be more important for people's mental health than the quantity of greenspace. Existing literature mainly focuses on greenspace quantity and is limited to exposure metrics based on an over-head perspective (i.e., remote sensing data). Thus, whether greenspace quantity and quality influence mental health through different mechanisms remains unclear. To compare the mechanisms through which greenspace quantity and quality influence mental health, we used both remote sensing and street view data. Questionnaire data from 1003 participants in Guangzhou, China were analysed cross-sectionally. Mental health was assessed through the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Greenspace quantity was measured by both remote sensing-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Street View Greenness-quantity (SVG-quantity). Greenspace quality was measured by both Street View Greenness-quality (SVG-quality) and questionnaire-based self-reported greenspace quality. Structural equation models were used to assess mechanisms through which neighbourhood greenspace exposure has an influence on mental health. Stress, social cohesion, physical activity and life satisfaction were found to mediate both SVG-quality - WHO-5 scores and self-reported greenspace quality - WHO-5 scores associations. However, only NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) mediated the association between NDVI and WHO-5 scores, while NO2, perceived pollution and social cohesion mediated the association between SVG-quantity and WHO-5 scores. The mechanisms through which neighbourhood greenspace exposure influences mental health may vary across different exposure assessment strategies. Greenspace quantity influences mental health through reducing harm from pollution, while greenspace quality influences mental health through restoring and building capacities.},

Environmental benefits of urban trees are well understood, but no review to date has examined how urban trees affect human health. This review provides a comprehensive summary of existing literature on the health impacts of urban trees that can inform future research, policy, and nature-based public health interventions. A systematic search used keywords representing human health, environmental health, and urban forestry. Following screening and appraisal of several thousand articles, 201 studies were conceptually sorted into a three-part framework. Reducing Harm, representing 41\% of studies, includes topics such as air pollution, ultraviolet radiation, heat exposure, and pollen. Restoring Capacities, at 31\%, includes attention restoration, mental health, stress reduction, and clinical outcomes. Building Capacities, at 28\%, includes topics such as birth outcomes, active living, and weight status. The studies that were reviewed show substantial heterogeneity in purpose and method yet indicate important health outcomes associated with people's exposure to trees. This review will help inform future research and practice, and demonstrates why urban forest planning and management should strategically promote trees as a social determinant of public health.},

However, there is very good reason to expect that variations in ecological ``quality'' (number of species, integrity of ecological processes) may influence the link between access to green space and benefits to human health and well-being. We test the relationship between green space quality and restorative benefit in an inner city urban population in Bradford, United Kingdom. We selected 12 urban parks for study where we carried out botanical and faunal surveys to quantify biodiversity and assessed the site facilities of the green space (cleanliness, provision of amenities). We also conducted 128 surveys with park users to quantify psychological restoration based on four self-reported measure of general restoration, attention-grabbing distractions, being away from everyday life, and site preference. We present three key results. First, there is a positive association between site facilities and biodiversity. Second, restorative benefit is predicted by biodiversity, which explained 43\% of the variance in restorative benefit across the parks, with minimal input from other variables. Third, the benefits accrued through access to green space were unrelated to age, gender, and ethnic background. The results add to a small but growing body of evidence that emphasize the role of nature in contributing to the well-being of urban populations and, hence, the need to consider biodiversity in the design of landscapes that enhance multiple ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {Background Epidemiological studies on the association of residential greenness with sleep quality are limited in China. Objective This study aims to investigate the association of long-term exposure to residential greenness with sleep quality in rural China. Methods In our study, 27,654 rural residents were selected from 4 counties of Henan Province by a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling method. Participants' sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), two satellite-derived vegetation indexes, were used to assess the level of residential greenness. Long-term greenness exposure was defined as the averages of NDVI and EVI during the three years prior to the baseline survey. The relationship between sleep quality and greenness was assessed using the mixed-effect linear regression models. Results Among 27,654 rural residents, the mean age was 55.89~years (standard deviation, SD~=~12.22) and 60.18\% of them were female. In the crude model, the PSQI score decreased with per interquartile range (IQR) increase in EVI and NDVI [{$\Delta$}PSQI score (95\% confidence interval, 95\%CI): -0.073 (-0.115, -0.030) and -0.047 (-0.089, -0.002)]. After controlling potential confounders, {$\Delta$}PSQI scores and 95\%CIs were -0.055 (-0.095, -0.012) and -0.090 (-0.151, -0.025) associated with per IQR increment in EVI and NDVI. The results of stratified analyses showed the effect of residential greenness on sleep was stronger among males and individuals with higher household income and educational attainment than females and those with lower household income and educational attainment. Moreover, the modification effect of air pollution was observed in the greenness-sleep association. Conclusions Our study indicated that higher residential greenness was significantly associated with better sleep quality in Chinese rural population, which highlights the significant effect of green space on human health.},

  abstract = {Quantifiable information on urban green spaces (UGS) (with their quality and distribution) is critical for sustainable urban development. The timely monitoring of UGS quality allows us to reveal relevant spatial differentiation laws at different scales and propose effective green planning guides. However, UGS quantity and quality in China remain unknown owing to a lack of large-scale studies. We utilized an urban neighborhood green index (UNGI) model to accurately characterize the UGS quality at a 100-m grid-scale in Chinese built-up areas using the FROM-GLC10 land-cover product and building height data. Furthermore, we explored the differentiation law of UGS quality at various spatial scales and its influencing factors using the geographic detector model. The results demonstrate that the average UNGI value in China is 52.17, and its overall quality is at a medium level. The UNGI values in most cities present a spatial differentiation pattern of ``low core and high periphery.'' UNGI values in the western and northeastern regions are slightly higher than those in the eastern and central regions. At the urban scale, the UNGI values in most cities are from 45 to 60. At the urban functional area scale, the UNGI values for public service land are significantly higher than those for other urban functional areas. Furthermore, the UGS quality correlates with different hierarchical cities and urbanization development stages. The UNGI values in super-megacities, megacities, and small cities are higher than those in large and medium cities. Additionally, the UGS quality in the final urbanization development stage was significantly higher than that in the initial stage. The geographic detector model's results demonstrate that numerous and complex factors affect the UGS quality, and population plays a dominant role in UGS. These results can assist urban administrators in green space planning and sustainable urban development.},

  abstract = {There is increasing evidence that the quality of green space significantly contributes to neighborhood satisfaction and well-being, independent of the mere amount of green space. In this paper, we examined residents' perceptions of the quality and beneficial affordances of green space in relation to objectively assessed accessibility and usability. We used data from a survey in two neighborhoods (N = 223) of a medium-sized city in the Netherlands, which were similar in the amount of green space and other physical and socio-demographic characteristics, but differed in the availability of accessible and usable green spaces. Results show that residents of the neighborhood with a higher availability of accessible and usable green spaces were more satisfied with their neighborhood. This difference was statistically mediated by the higher level of perceived green space quality. Neighborhood satisfaction was significantly positively related to well-being. However, residents of the two neighborhoods did not differ in self-reported well-being and beneficial affordances of green space. These analyses contribute to a further understanding of how the accessibility and usability of green spaces may increase people's neighborhood satisfaction. It highlights the importance of perceived quality in addition to the amount of green space when examining the beneficial effects of green space.},
