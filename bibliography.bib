  abstract = {Greenspace in urban areas may have greater protective health effects than elsewhere. Urban dwellers experience more environmental harmful exposures, attentional demands, and stressors than their suburban/rural counterparts. In this systematic review, we synthesize the results of studies that examined how the greenspace and health relationship varies by urbanicity. We searched for articles in April 2019 that found positive associations between greenspace and physical health. Included articles tested for effect modification by urbanicity among one or more (of eight total) outcomes relevant to health and environmental equity. We coded results as 1~=~stronger association in more urban areas, -1~=~stronger association in less urban areas, or 0~=~no difference. We found 57 analyses in 37 articles that met our inclusion criteria. Among these analyses, 50.9\% showed no difference, 38.6\% showed a stronger association for more urban areas, and 10.5\% showed a stronger association for less urban areas. More urban areas had stronger associations for cardiovascular-related, birth, and mortality outcomes and for greenspace measured within 500~m. Stronger greenspace-health associations in more urban areas might be explained in part by the mechanistic pathways underlying these associations. Greenspace can reduce harms from environmental exposures (i.e., air pollution, noise, heat, and artificial light at night) in addition to alleviating attentional demands, reducing chronic stressors, and promoting healthy behavior - factors which might be more necessary, prevalent, or stronger in urban areas. These potential explanations warrant further investigation. The findings of this review inform public health policy and planning professionals who are attempting to make cities livable for all residents.},

  abstract = {While local-area greenspace is associated with reduced symptoms of mental distress and greater life satisfaction, most previous research has measured the amount of local-area greenspace within administrative boundaries, and found mixed results for associations between greenspace and multidimensional mental wellbeing. The study was designed to examine whether the amount of greenspace within a radius of individuals' homes was associated with mental wellbeing, testing the government guideline that greenspace should be available within 300\,m of homes. Individual and Household-level data were drawn from the Annual Population Survey at postcode level (APS, Pooled Dataset 2012\textendash 2015), which includes 3 mental wellbeing measures, covering aspects of life satisfaction, sense of worth, and happiness, as well as a range of socio-demographic variables. Greenspace data were obtained Greenspace Information for Greater London Group (GiGL), and was used to calculated the amount of greenspace within a 300\,m radius of individuals. Linear regression models revealed positive and statistically significant associations between the amount of greenspace and indicators of life satisfaction and worth. Moran's I, an indicator of spatial autocorrelation, revealed statistically significant clustering of the residuals of these models, so Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models were calculated, in order to adjust for underlying spatial processes within the data and investigate the geographic variation in the association between local greenspace and mental wellbeing. The global GWR model revealed that an increase in 1\,ha of greenspace within 300\,m of residents was associated with a statistically significant 0.803 increase in life satisfaction, 0.740 and 0.521 for worth and happiness, respectively. This therefore provides some support for the inclusion of greenspace within 300\,m of homes. Local GWR coefficients revealed slight variation in the strength of these associations across the study space. Therefore, further analyses are required to investigate whether the walking (network distance), absolute size, or type of each greenspace are able to explain this spatial variation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a rapidly urbanizing world, many people have little contact with natural environments, which may affect health and well-being. Existing reviews generally conclude that residential greenspace is beneficial to health. However, the processes generating these benefits and how they can be best promoted remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: During an Expert Workshop held in September 2016, the evidence linking greenspace and health was reviewed from a transdisciplinary standpoint, with a particular focus on potential underlying biopsychosocial pathways and how these can be explored and organized to support policy-relevant population health research. DISCUSSIONS: Potential pathways linking greenspace to health are here presented in three domains, which emphasize three general functions of greenspace: reducing harm (e.g. reducing exposure to air pollution, noise and heat), restoring capacities (e.g. attention restoration and physiological stress recovery) and building capacities (e.g. encouraging physical activity and facilitating social cohesion). Interrelations between among the three domains are also noted. Among several recommendations, future studies should: use greenspace and behavioural measures that are relevant to hypothesized pathways; include assessment of presence, access and use of greenspace; use longitudinal, interventional and (quasi)experimental study designs to assess causation; and include low and middle income countries given their absence in the existing literature. Cultural, climatic, geographic and other contextual factors also need further consideration. CONCLUSIONS: While the existing evidence affirms beneficial impacts of greenspace on health, much remains to be learned about the specific pathways and functional form of such relationships, and how these may vary by context, population groups and health outcomes. This Report provides guidance for further epidemiological research with the goal of creating new evidence upon which to develop policy recommendations.},

Depression is the most common mental disorder in the world, but it is unclear how urbanization and urban living affect depression outcomes. Grounded in a previously articulated conceptual framework, we systematically reviewed recently published studies on urbanization, urbanicity, and depression. RECENT FINDINGS: Eleven articles were included in this review. Four studies found that living in urban areas was associated with elevated odds or more symptoms of depression. Three studies - all done in China - estimated protective effects of urbanization or urbanicity on depression. Two studies concluded no overall clear association. The remaining two articles stratified by urbanicity and found that greenspace was inversely associated with depression in more densely populated areas relative to rural areas. Other themes discussed included global and national trends such as aging, immigration, and planned urbanization in China, as well as urban living conditions such as traffic noise, air pollution, proximity to roadways, neighborhood social capital, and social cohesion. SUMMARY: Urbanization may affect depression differentially across geographic regions and income levels. More research is needed, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries, and on intersections between urbanization and other emerging global trends.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased urbanisation and the associated reduced contact of individuals with natural environments have led to a rise in mental disorders, including depression. Residential greenness, a fundamental component of urban design, has been shown to reduce the public health burden of mental disorders. The present study investigates the association between residential green exposure and prevalence of major depressive disorders using a large and diverse cross-sectional dataset from the UK Biobank. METHODS: In this cross-sectional, observational, associational study, we used baseline data from the UK Biobank cohort of participants aged 37-73 years from across the UK. Environmental exposure data were derived from a modelled and linked built environment database. Residential greenness was assessed with a 0{$\cdot$}5 m resolution Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, which is derived from spectral reflectance measurements in remotely sensed colour infrared data and measured within geocoded dwelling catchments. Other environment metrics included street-level movement density, terrain, and fine particulate exposures. A series of logistic models examined associations between residential greenness and odds of major depressive disorder after adjusting for activity-influencing environments and individual covariates. FINDINGS: Of 122\hphantom{,}993 participants with data on major depressive disorder, the study analytical sample comprised 94\hphantom{,}879 (77{$\cdot$}1\%) participants recruited across ten UK Biobank assessment centres between April 29, 2009, and Oct 1, 2010. A protective effect of greenness on depression was consistently observed, with 4{$\cdot$}0\% lower odds of major depressive disorder per interquartile increment in Normalised Difference Vegetation Index greenness (odds ratio 0{$\cdot$}960, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}93-0{$\cdot$}99; p=0{$\cdot$}0044). Interaction analyses indicated that the beneficial effects of greenness were more pronounced among women, participants younger than 60 years, and participants residing in areas with low neighbourhood socioeconomic status or high urbanicity. INTERPRETATION: The results point to the benefits of well designed green environments on mental health. Further longitudinal studies are needed to decipher causal pathways. In the UK, policies aimed at optimising allocation and design of green spaces might help preserve psychological ecosystem services, thereby, improving the mental wellbeing of populations and enhancing the mental capital of cities.

  abstract = {Since the burden of chronic diseases is rising globally, there is an urgent need to develop population-level approaches to reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Neighborhood environments, where people spend much of their time, are relevant in this context because they can influence residents' daily behaviors related to health. In particular, public green spaces (PGS) can confer health benefits through facilitating physical activity, contact with nature, and social interaction. PGS may also mitigate socio-economic inequalities in health. However, despite growing evidence, PGS are generally not fully utilized as a resource for physical activity. Thus, there is substantial scope for enhancing population health through increased visits and active use of PGS. This essay argues that PGS are not only health-enhancing but also practical and workable environmental resources to promote population health. We discuss three ``advantages'' of using PGS as health promotion initiatives: PGS are easier to modify (than are other structural environmental features); PGS can involve programs to help residents initiate physical activity; and PGS are valued by residents. The essay concludes with a discussion of future research topics, the result of which can be used to convince and assist local authorities and other key stakeholders to use PGS as readily available resources for health promotion.},

  abstract = {Non-motorized outdoor recreation contributes significantly to the U.S. economy by providing over six million jobs and \$88 billion in federal and state tax revenues (Southwick Associates, 2013). Participation in non-motorized wildland recreation, defined in this paper as non-motorized outdoor recreation that is dependent on the natural resources of an undeveloped natural setting, has increased in recent years with half of Americans participating annually (Outdoor Foundation, 2017). There has been a growing field of evidence demonstrating the relationship between natural settings and human health (e.g., Frumkin, 2001). This research suggests that the qualities and characteristics of setting may enhance or inhibit health outcomes (e.g., Kellert, Heerwagen, \& Mador, 2011). Wildland settings (e.g., national parks, national forests, refuges) have unique characteristics that are thought to contribute to human health through the activities that take place in these settings. Similar to the components outlined by Hammitt, Cole, and Monz (2015), our study focuses on wildland recreation and explores the potential relationships between recreation on wildlands and physical and mental health. To date, there has not been a comprehensive and systematic review of the literature exploring how recreation that takes place in wildland settings influences physical and mental health and if these health outcomes differ from recreation in other more urban and exurban outdoor settings (e.g., urban green space). This is particularly important because society faces a range of chronic and acute health challenges and many argue that outdoor recreation in wildland settings offers an important antidote to many of these health challenges. Yet, without investigating and summarizing the results of peer-reviewed investigations, we have little understanding of the potential for wildland recreation improving mental and physical health. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed empirical studies of wildland recreation activities and assessed physical and mental health outcomes. We investigated whether wildland recreation positively contributed to a range of physical and mental health outcomes, the type of recreation activity, where the activity occurred, and if outcomes were positive, why the health benefit occurred. Our analysis explores aspects and focus areas wildland recreation health research (i.e., most studies focused on hiking; how recreational activities impact mental and physical health; and aspects of the physical setting, the recreational activity, and the social atmosphere that influence health). We discuss these trends and outline recommendations for future research to expand our understanding of the linkages between wildland recreation and human health. Our research has implications for managers and researchers. For researchers studying the connections between wildland recreation and human health, this review facilitated identification of trends and gaps which can inform and strengthen this area of research. For managers of wildlands and individuals working to address physical and mental health, our study offers empirical evidence of the connections between wildlands and human health, and can inform how best to manage such lands to promote health benefits.},

  abstract = {Exposure to greenspace has been related to improved mental health, but the available evidence is limited and findings are heterogeneous across different areas. We aimed to evaluate the associations between residential exposure to greenspace and specific psychopathological and psychosomatic symptoms related to mental health among mothers from a Spanish birth cohort. Our study was based on data from 1171 women participating in two follow-ups of a population-based cohort in Valencia, Sabadell, and Gipuzkoa (2004\textendash 2012). For each participant, residential surrounding greenspace was estimated as the average of the satellite-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) across different buffers around the residential address at the time of delivery and at the 4-year follow-up. The Symptom Checklist 90 Revised (SCL-90-R) was applied to characterize mental health at the 4-year follow-up. We developed mixed-effects logistic regression models controlled for relevant covariates to evaluate the associations. Higher residential surrounding greenspace was associated with a lower risk of somatization and anxiety symptoms. For General Severity Index (GSI), obsessive\textendash compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism symptoms, we generally observed protective associations, but none attained statistical significance. Findings from this study suggested a potential positive impactof greenspace on mental health.},

  abstract = {Residential greenspace quality may be more important for people's mental health than the quantity of greenspace. Existing literature mainly focuses on greenspace quantity and is limited to exposure metrics based on an over-head perspective (i.e., remote sensing data). Thus, whether greenspace quantity and quality influence mental health through different mechanisms remains unclear. To compare the mechanisms through which greenspace quantity and quality influence mental health, we used both remote sensing and street view data. Questionnaire data from 1003 participants in Guangzhou, China were analysed cross-sectionally. Mental health was assessed through the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Greenspace quantity was measured by both remote sensing-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Street View Greenness-quantity (SVG-quantity). Greenspace quality was measured by both Street View Greenness-quality (SVG-quality) and questionnaire-based self-reported greenspace quality. Structural equation models were used to assess mechanisms through which neighbourhood greenspace exposure has an influence on mental health. Stress, social cohesion, physical activity and life satisfaction were found to mediate both SVG-quality - WHO-5 scores and self-reported greenspace quality - WHO-5 scores associations. However, only NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) mediated the association between NDVI and WHO-5 scores, while NO2, perceived pollution and social cohesion mediated the association between SVG-quantity and WHO-5 scores. The mechanisms through which neighbourhood greenspace exposure influences mental health may vary across different exposure assessment strategies. Greenspace quantity influences mental health through reducing harm from pollution, while greenspace quality influences mental health through restoring and building capacities.},

Benefits potentially arise via several mechanisms including stress reduction, opportunity and motivation for physical activity, and reduced air pollution exposure. However, the evidence is mixed and sometimes inconclusive. One explanation may be that ``greenspace'' is typically treated as a homogenous environment type. However, recent research has revealed that different types and qualities of natural environments may influence health and wellbeing to different extents.},

This study uses a validated measure of positive mental health and data from RESIDential Environments (RESIDE) Project to investigate the association between the presence, amount and attributes of public green space in new greenfield neighbourhood developments and the mental health of local residents (n = 492). Both the overall number and total area of public green spaces were significantly associated with greater mental wellbeing, and findings support a dose-response relationship. Positive mental health was not only associated with parks with a nature focus, but also with green spaces characterised by recreational and sporting activity. The study demonstrates that adequate provision of public green space in local neighbourhoods and within walking distance is important for positive mental health.},

  abstract = {There is increasing evidence that the quality of green space significantly contributes to neighborhood satisfaction and well-being, independent of the mere amount of green space. In this paper, we examined residents' perceptions of the quality and beneficial affordances of green space in relation to objectively assessed accessibility and usability. We used data from a survey in two neighborhoods (N = 223) of a medium-sized city in the Netherlands, which were similar in the amount of green space and other physical and socio-demographic characteristics, but differed in the availability of accessible and usable green spaces. Results show that residents of the neighborhood with a higher availability of accessible and usable green spaces were more satisfied with their neighborhood. This difference was statistically mediated by the higher level of perceived green space quality. Neighborhood satisfaction was significantly positively related to well-being. However, residents of the two neighborhoods did not differ in self-reported well-being and beneficial affordances of green space. These analyses contribute to a further understanding of how the accessibility and usability of green spaces may increase people's neighborhood satisfaction. It highlights the importance of perceived quality in addition to the amount of green space when examining the beneficial effects of green space.},
