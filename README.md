## Getting Set Up

Let's try and write as much of this through GitHub and Markdown as we can... While Zotero and other software works fine with Google Docs, it's a lot easier to have formats and citations be consistent if we do it this way. Of course, I'm happy to bring things into Markdown if need be, but it's a pretty good skill to have to be able to do this!

Anyways, here's some info/resources to help us stay on the same page!

Software:

- Git & GitHub Desktop
  - Obviously, we all need GitHub accounts to edit the repo, but having things on our desktop allows us to make commits and save our progress a lot more easily.
- Visual Studio Code
  - Not essential, but if you have the right extensions it can be a wonderful text editor for scientific writing. I'll help everyone get set up with this, but for reference, I haven't opened MS Word in over a year. There's a bit of a learning curve, of course, but it makes things very easy to collaborate on a paper.
  - Also, having things in Markdown rather than MS Word makes it *significantly* easier to manage conflicts; i.e. if more than one person is editing the same file at a time.
- R Studio
  - R Studio also has Git support, so if we have any sort of datasets or analyses that we want to include, this makes it a lot easier to manage than everyone working off of their own copy.

As far as getting set up with how to actually write using Markdown and GitHub, I'm happy to help get everyone on the same page. GitHub is great, not only for having incremental file management (backups!) but also because of the Issues feature; basically, a built-in todo list of what we need to change, add, etc., which can be embedded directly into our document, sort of like comments on a Google Doc.
